# Copy application code with ownership baked in.
# Using `COPY --chown` instead of `COPY` + `chown -R /app` avoids an
# extra image layer that duplicates the entire /app tree just to flip
# ownership bits — Docker layers are immutable, so chown -R rewrites
# every file into a new layer. On a clean repo that's small; if any
# bulky workspace file slips in (e.g. auto-downloaded ffmpeg binaries
# in tools/), it gets counted twice in the image. Cin caught this on
# 2026-05-08 — see the .dockerignore comment for the same incident.

# Create runtime mount-point directories the app expects to exist.
# NOTE: /app/data is for database FILES, /app/database is the Python package
# NOTE: /app/Staging is required even though most users bind-mount it —
# the entrypoint mkdir runs early and is gated by `set -e`, so a missing
# pre-baked directory would crash the container into a restart loop on
# rootless Docker/Podman where in-container "root" can't write to /app.
# Pre-baking the dir here makes the entrypoint mkdir a guaranteed no-op.
# NOTE: /app/Stream is the transient single-file streaming cache used by
# the basic-search "Play" flow (cleared per use, never persistent). It's
# created lazily by `core/streaming/prepare.py` via `os.makedirs`, which
# fails silently on rootless Docker where the soulsync UID can't write
# to /app — playback then errors out with no obvious cause. Pre-baking
# at build time (when the layer is owned by root) avoids that path.
# NOTE: /app/storage is the PRIVATE album-bundle staging area for the
# torrent / usenet whole-release flow (download_source.album_bundle_staging_path
# defaults to 'storage/album_bundle_staging'). Like /app/Stream it's created
# lazily at runtime via mkdir(parents=True); without pre-baking it owned by
# soulsync, the album-bundle copy fails with "[Errno 13] Permission denied:
# 'storage'" because /app itself is root-owned and the soulsync UID can't
# create a top-level dir there.
