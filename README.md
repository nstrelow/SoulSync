## What It Does

SoulSync bridges streaming services to your music library with automated discovery:

1. **Monitors artists** → Automatically detects new releases from your watchlist
2. **Generates playlists** → Release Radar, Discovery Weekly, Seasonal, Decade/Genre mixes, Cache-powered discovery
3. **Downloads missing tracks** → From Soulseek, Deezer, Tidal, Qobuz, HiFi, Amazon Music, YouTube, or any combination via Hybrid mode
4. **Verifies downloads** → AcoustID fingerprinting for all download sources
5. **Enriches metadata** → 14 enrichment workers (Spotify, MusicBrainz, iTunes, Deezer, Discogs, AudioDB, Last.fm, Genius, Tidal, Qobuz, JioSaavn, Amazon, Bandcamp, Similar Artists)
6. **Tags consistently** → Picard-style MusicBrainz release preflight ensures all album tracks get the same release ID
7. **Organizes files** → Custom templates for clean folder structures
8. **Manages library** → Plex, Jellyfin, Navidrome, or SoulSync Standalone (no media server required)
9. **Scrobbles plays** → Automatic scrobbling to Last.fm and ListenBrainz from your media server

**Plus a full video side.** SoulSync also manages **Movies, TV Shows, and YouTube** — the same discovery, automation, and enrichment approach applied to video, with its own isolated database, dashboard, and pipeline. Works with Plex and Jellyfin. See **[Video Library](#video-library--movies-tv-shows--youtube)** below.

- Blasphemy Mode — delete original FLAC after conversion
- Synchronized lyrics (LRC) via LRClib
- ReplayGain analysis — optional track-level loudness tagging via ffmpeg, runs before lossy copy so both files get tagged
- Picard-style album consistency — pre-flight MusicBrainz release lookup ensures all tracks get the same release ID

### Listening Stats & Scrobbling

**Listening Stats Page** — Full dashboard with Chart.js visualizations
- Overview cards: total plays, listening time, unique artists/albums/tracks
- Timeline bar chart, genre breakdown donut with legend
- Top artists visual bubbles, top albums and tracks with play buttons and cover art
- Library health: format breakdown bar, enrichment coverage rings, database storage chart
- Time range filters: 7 days, 30 days, 12 months, all time

**Scrobbling** — Automatic Last.fm and ListenBrainz scrobbling from Plex, Jellyfin, or Navidrome

### Audio Verification

**AcoustID Fingerprinting** (optional) — Verifies downloaded files match expected tracks
- Runs for all download sources (Soulseek, Tidal, Qobuz, HiFi, Deezer, Amazon Music, YouTube)
- Catches wrong versions (live, remix, cover) even from streaming API sources
- Fail-open design: verification errors never block downloads

#### AcoustID API key

AcoustID verification is opt-in. To enable it, request a free API key
at <https://acoustid.org/new-application> and paste it into
Settings → AcoustID. Without a key, downloads still complete but the
verification step is skipped silently.

If a track was previously tagged by AcoustID but the retag action in
the AcoustID Scanner no longer changes anything, see issue #704 — the
most common cause is that the file already carries a
`MUSICBRAINZ_TRACKID` tag, which the retag step uses as a short-circuit
and therefore never overwrites. Removing the cached
`MUSICBRAINZ_TRACKID` (and the `ACOUSTID_ID` if present) from the file
restores the retag.

### Metadata & Enrichment

**14 Background Enrichment Workers**: Spotify, MusicBrainz, iTunes, Deezer, Discogs, AudioDB, Last.fm, Genius, Tidal, Qobuz, JioSaavn, Amazon, Bandcamp, Similar Artists — plus SoulID generation
- Each worker independently processes artists, albums, and tracks
- Pause/resume controls on dashboard (animated worker orbs show live status), auto-pause during database scans
- Error items don't auto-retry in infinite loops (fixed in v2.1)

**Multi-Source Metadata**
- Primary source selectable: Spotify, iTunes/Apple Music, Deezer, or Discogs
- Spotify no longer auto-overrides — user chooses their preferred source in Settings
- Spotify auth still enables playlists, followed artists, and enrichment
- MusicBrainz enrichment with Picard-style album consistency

**Hydrabase** (optional P2P metadata network) — replaces iTunes as the metadata source when connected. Federated lookup with community-matched results, falls back automatically if disconnected. Dev-mode feature, enable in Settings → Connections.

**Genre Whitelist** — filter junk genre tags (artist names, radio show names, playlist names) from all enrichment sources. 272 curated default genres, fully customizable. Off by default for backward compatibility.

**Post-Processing Tag Embedding**
- Granular per-service tag toggles (18+ MusicBrainz tags, Spotify/iTunes/Deezer IDs, AudioDB mood/style, Tidal/Qobuz ISRCs, Last.fm tags, Genius URLs)
- Multi-artist tagging options: configurable separator (comma/semicolon/slash), multi-value ARTISTS tag for Navidrome/Jellyfin multi-artist linking, optional "move featured artists to title" mode
- Album art embedding, cover.jpg download
- Spotify rate limit protection across all API calls

#### Self-hosted MusicBrainz

SoulSync can use a MusicBrainz-compatible mirror for enrichment, metadata lookups,
search, and repair. In Settings → Connections → MusicBrainz, enter
your server URL and request interval, then save. All clients use the saved values
on their next request; no restart is needed. Leave the URL blank to return to
public MusicBrainz.

Alternatively, add these variables to the SoulSync service's Docker Compose
`environment` block, then recreate the container:

```yaml
environment:
  SOULSYNC_MUSICBRAINZ_BASE_URL: "http://musicbrainz:5000/ws/2"
  SOULSYNC_MUSICBRAINZ_REQUEST_INTERVAL: "0.1"
```

Use your server's address as reachable **from SoulSync**. `musicbrainz` above is
an example service name on a shared Docker network; `localhost` inside SoulSync's
container points to SoulSync itself. For a non-Docker installation, set the same
environment variables before starting SoulSync and restart it after changes.

The interval is the minimum number of seconds between request starts across
clients in one SoulSync process. `0.1` permits up to 10 requests/second, subject
to server latency and sequential processing; `0` disables the pacing delay for
a private mirror. Choose a rate your server supports. Defaults remain
`https://musicbrainz.org/ws/2` and `1.05` seconds. Public `musicbrainz.org` hosts
retain a minimum 1.05-second interval even if a faster rate is configured.
Retries use the same limiter and retain their error backoff.

The URL accepts HTTP or HTTPS, an optional port and reverse-proxy prefix, and
an optional `/ws/2` suffix (added automatically). Use the final API URL: redirects
are rejected to prevent a mirror forwarding high-rate requests to the public
service. Embedded credentials, query strings and fragments are not supported.
Invalid URLs or negative/nonfinite intervals produce an explicit configuration
error; they do not silently fall back to the public server.

Equivalent persisted settings are `musicbrainz.base_url` and
`musicbrainz.request_interval`; see `config/config.example.json`. Environment
variables take precedence. Existing installations load configuration from the
database, so editing `config/config.json` alone is not a reliable way to change
these settings; use the Settings UI or environment overrides above. Environment changes require a process restart or container recreation.

The mirror needs both MusicBrainz lookup/browse endpoints and local search
indexes for artist, release and recording searches. See the official
[MusicBrainz server setup](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Server/Setup)
and [search architecture](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Development/Search_Architecture).
Cover Art Archive remains external. Changing servers preserves existing MBIDs,
match caches and retry schedules; it does not automatically reprocess previously
unmatched items. A mirror outage does not trigger fallback to the public API.

### Advanced Matching Engine

- Version-aware matching: strictly rejects remixes when you want the original (and vice versa)
- Unicode and accent handling (KoЯn, Bjork, A$AP Rocky)
- Fuzzy matching with weighted confidence scoring (title, artist, duration)
- Album variation detection (Deluxe, Remastered, Taylor's Version, etc.)
- Streaming source match validation: same confidence scoring applied to Tidal/Qobuz/HiFi/Deezer results as Soulseek
- Short title protection: prevents "Love" from matching "Loveless"

### Automation

**Automation Engine** — Visual drag-and-drop builder for custom workflows
- **Triggers**: Schedule, Daily/Weekly Time, Track Downloaded, Batch Complete, Playlist Changed, Discovery Complete, Signal Received, Library Scan Complete, Watchlist Match, Wishlist Item Added, and more
- **Actions**: Process Wishlist, Scan Watchlist, Refresh Mirrored, Discover Playlist, Sync Playlist, Scan Library, Database Update, Quality Scan, Full Cleanup, and 10+ more
- **Then Actions** (up to 3 per automation): Fire Signal (chain to other automations), Discord/Telegram/Pushbullet notifications, audible chimes
- **Signal Chains** — One automation fires `signal:foo`, another listens for it. Cycle detection + chain depth limit + cooldown prevent runaway chains.
- **Playlist Pipeline** — Single automation for full playlist lifecycle: refresh → discover → sync → download missing. No manual signal wiring.
- **Pipelines** — Pre-built one-click deployments (New Music, Nightly Operations, Full Library Maintenance, etc.) that install a linked group of automations at once
- **Automation Groups** — Drag-and-drop organization, bulk enable/disable, rename, right-click context menus

**Watchlist** — Monitor unlimited artists with per-artist configuration
- Release type filters: Albums, EPs, Singles
- Content filters: Live, Remixes, Acoustic, Compilations
- Auto-discover similar artists, periodic scanning

**Wishlist** — Failed downloads automatically queued for retry with auto-processing

**Mirrored Playlists** — Mirror from Spotify, Tidal, YouTube, Deezer and keep synced
- Auto-refresh detects source changes via URL/ID tracking in playlist metadata
- Discovery pipeline matches source tracks to user's primary metadata source (Spotify/iTunes/Deezer/Discogs)
- Auto Wing It fallback — tracks that fail all metadata APIs get stub metadata from the raw source title and flow through the normal download pipeline anyway
- Followed Spotify playlists that hit 403 errors fall back to public embed scraper
- Unmatch button on found tracks with DB persistence for mirrored playlists

**Local Profiles** — Multiple profiles with isolated settings, watchlists, and playlists
- **Per-profile side access** — each profile can be music-only, video-only, or both; single-side profiles never see the side switcher
- Per-profile page access, login passwords / quick-switch PINs, per-profile Spotify + Tidal accounts (My Accounts)

### Library Management

**Dashboard** — Service status, system stats, activity feed, enrichment worker controls
- Unified glass UI design across all tool cards, service cards, and stat cards

**Library Page** — Artist grid with staggered card animations, per-artist enrichment coverage rings
- Artist Radio button — play random track with auto-queue radio mode
- Play buttons on Last.fm top tracks sidebar

**Enhanced Library Manager** — Toggle between Standard and Enhanced views
- Inline metadata editing, per-service manual matching
- Write Tags to File (MP3/FLAC/OGG/M4A), tag preview with diff
- Server sync after tag writes (Plex, Jellyfin, Navidrome)
- Bulk operations, sortable columns, multi-disc support
- **Re-identify** — re-file an imported track under a different release (staged back through the import pipeline; the original is never deleted until the re-import succeeds)
- **Artist photo picker** — hover the artist image, pick from every connected source; updates SoulSync, your media server, and artist.jpg on disk (what Navidrome reads) in one click
- Enhance Quality (upgrade tracks to FLAC/higher bitrate) and Reorganize Album modals

**Library Maintenance** — 10+ automated repair jobs
- Track Number, Dead Files, Duplicates, Metadata Gaps, Album Completeness, Missing Cover Art, AcoustID Scanner, Orphan Files, Fake Lossless, Library Reorganize, Lossy Converter, MBID Mismatch, Album Tag Consistency, Live/Commentary Cleaner
- Enrichment workers auto-pause during database scans
- One-click Fix All with findings dashboard

**Database Storage Visualization** — Donut chart showing per-table storage breakdown

**Live Log Viewer** — Real-time terminal-style log viewer on Settings → Logs. Color-coded levels (DEBUG/INFO/WARNING/ERROR), live filter + search, switch between log files (app, post-processing, AcoustID, source reuse). Auto-scroll, copy, clear. Updates via WebSocket every 0.5s.

**Import System** — Tag-first matching, auto-grouped album cards, staging folder workflow
- **Exact-ID identification first** — a Spotify link in the comment tag resolves 1:1; ISRC tags resolve the album by folder consensus (fixes text-search failures on Japanese releases)
- Auto-Import worker: recursive scan, single file support, AcoustID fingerprinting fallback
- Confidence-gated: 90%+ auto-imports, 70-90% queued for review
- `.lrc` lyrics sidecars travel with their tracks (imports and downloads), renamed to match

**SoulSync Standalone Mode** — Use SoulSync without Plex, Jellyfin, or Navidrome
- Downloads and imports write directly to the library database
- Filesystem scanner for incremental and deep scan of Transfer folder
- Pre-populated enrichment IDs from download context (Spotify, Deezer, MusicBrainz)
- Select in Settings → Connections → Standalone

**Template Organization** — `$albumartist/$album/$track - $title` and 10+ variables

### Built-in Media Player

- Stream tracks from your library with queue system
- Now Playing modal with album art ambient glow and Web Audio visualizer
- Smart Radio mode — auto-queue similar tracks by genre, mood, and style
- Repeat modes, shuffle, keyboard shortcuts, Media Session API

### Mobile Responsive

- Comprehensive mobile layouts across both sides — every music page plus the full video side (dashboard through both Studios)
- Artist hero section, enhanced library track table with bottom sheet action popover
- Enrichment rings, filter bars, and discover cards all adapt to narrow screens

---

## Video Library — Movies, TV Shows & YouTube

A fully isolated video side that brings SoulSync's discovery/automation/enrichment philosophy to **movies, TV, and YouTube**. Its own database, dashboard, search, calendar, and download pipeline — sharing the automation engine but never touching the music side. Works with **Plex** and **Jellyfin** (per-server isolation).

### Libraries & Scanning

- **Plex + Jellyfin**, source-agnostic — Movies and TV are tracked as independent libraries
- **Three scan modes**: incremental (a modified-since delta — only re-reads what the server touched), deep (full re-read + prune removed), full (clean reset)
- **Smart post-download scan** — probes the server with a cheap search and skips the full crawl when it already has the newest grab
- Weekly deep scans (TV Mondays, Movies Tuesdays) + an hourly incremental safety net for manual additions

### Metadata & Enrichment

**Matchers** — TMDB (movies + shows), TVDB (shows + an episode-metadata fallback for titles/overviews TMDB lacks), OMDb (IMDb / Rotten Tomatoes / Metacritic ratings)

**12 background enrichment workers** — fanart.tv (logos/art), OpenSubtitles (subtitles), Return YouTube Dislike, SponsorBlock, DeArrow (better titles/thumbnails), YouTube upload dates, Trakt (ratings/votes), TVmaze, AniList (anime), Wikidata (official sites), TMDB watch providers (streaming availability), MediaStinger (after-credits scenes) — live status orbs on the dashboard, click to pause/resume, Manage Workers modal with per-service queues and manual matching

- **Gap-fill by design** — enrichment only fills what the media server left blank, never clobbers server data; per-field user locking (a locked field belongs to the user, enrichment skips it forever)
- **Rolling re-enrichment automation** — keeps ratings, overviews, art, and episode air-dates from going stale: re-pulls the stalest matched items by stored id (never re-search, so no mis-match risk), oldest first, ~monthly per item, self-healing OMDb daily-quota latch
- **Lazy on-view refresh** + a daily airing-schedule refresh keep what you're actively watching current

### Discover

- **Netflix-style billboard hero** with real title-logo art and a wishlist CTA, auto-rotating over trending titles
- A deep, **endlessly lazy-loading rail stack**: For You, Top 10 Today, personalized "Because you like…" rails, "On your streaming services", mood/studio/genre/decade/foreign rails
- Every rail opens as a paged **See All** grid; a **browse filter bar** (kind / genre / decade / provider / language / sort) builds arbitrary grids; **Hide owned** toggle
- Wishlist / In Library state on every card, everywhere

### Detail Pages & Search

- Source-agnostic **movie / show / person / studio** pages — cinematic full-bleed billboard with trailer autoplay, cast & crew, where-to-watch, similar titles, seasons & episodes
- **Get modal + download view** — see your quality target, judge any owned copy against it, then per-source **Manual** (pick the release yourself) or **Auto** (grab the best) search — or one header **Auto** that searches every source and grabs the single best
- **Play on Plex/Jellyfin** deep-link, four switchable season views, "Missing only" episode filter, **Wishlist Missing** (every missing aired episode across all seasons in one click)
- **Manage panel** — inline metadata edits with per-field locks (a locked field is yours forever), plus a per-service **match editor** (TMDB / TVDB / IMDb re-match)
- **Poster Manager** — full-screen artwork picker; writes poster.jpg, repoints the DB, pushes to the server
- **Progressive "Netflix-feel" search** — results stream in per group (movies, TV, YouTube channels, people, studios) as they arrive instead of one blocking load

### TV Calendar

- A real 7-column week grid (today first) with **time-band rows** (Prime Time etc.) and a "Now" cue lighting the current band
- A **"Next up" billboard hero** — the soonest episodes with Tonight/Today labels
- Scope toggle: your **watchlist** (followed ∪ airing) vs the **whole library**; compact/comfortable views
- Wishlist an aired-but-missing episode straight from the calendar modal

### Watchlist → Wishlist → Download Pipeline

**Follow anything** — shows, actors/directors (their whole filmography), studios, YouTube channels, YouTube playlists

- **Studio watchlist** — follow Pixar, A24, Disney… with **family presets** (Disney = Pixar + Marvel + Lucasfilm) and per-member selection (follow just Pixar if you want); a settled-films vote floor keeps obscure shorts out
- **People watchlist** — every un-owned movie a followed actor/director made, back catalog + upcoming
- **Look-ahead horizon** — upcoming titles are wishlisted only within ~1 year of theatrical/digital release, so the wishlist never fills with distant announcements but is never out of date
- **Sonarr-style airing** — wishlist every episode airing today for the shows you follow

### Downloads

- **Sources**: Soulseek (slskd), Prowlarr indexers (torrent + usenet), YouTube (yt-dlp) — reorderable hybrid chain with per-source toggles
- **Radarr/Sonarr-class quality profiles** — quality ladder, cutoff, upgrade-until-cutoff, reject rules, preferred-words scoring
- Fulfillment engine, download monitor, organization + sidecars + subtitle fetch, disk guard
- Downloads page: live rows with an expandable **detail drawer** (format facts, dest path, open item), batch grouping for season packs, cancel/retry per row
- **Permanent download-history archive** + a History modal (All / Movies / Shows / YouTube tabs)
- **Release blocklist** (auto-added only on proven-bad-file rejects, one-click block from failed rows, blocklist manager modal) + a **recycle bin** for reversible deletes

### Overlay Studio (Kometa-style overlays)

- Visual **overlay-template editor**, applied via Pillow directly onto Plex/Jellyfin posters
- Per-scope assignments (movie / show / season / episode), a logo-badge system (provider/resolution/rating badges)
- Nightly re-apply automation that skips items whose template + art + data are unchanged
- **Clean Up Plex Images** job reclaims the space poster re-uploads accumulate

### Collection Manager (Kometa-style collections)

- Build **Plex Collections / Jellyfin BoxSets** from smart filters and ranked lists
- **Ranked list sources**: IMDb charts & lists, TMDB charts & lists, Trakt lists, MDBList — rendered in true rank order (e.g. IMDb Top 250 by rank, not year)
- Franchise auto-backfill, a paginated gallery, and a nightly **Sync Collections** automation that pushes add/remove to the server

### YouTube

- **Follow channels as shows** and **playlists as shows** (yt-dlp, no API key) — long-form only, Shorts excluded
- **Import your subscriptions** — upload or paste a ytdl-sub / Kometa `subscriptions.yml` and follow everything in one background pass
- Paste any channel URL or `@handle` into video search to resolve + follow it
- Per-channel **keep windows / retention** with an old-episode cleanup job
- True downloaded-state tracking (ownership derived from download history) + ghost cleanup
- Headless-friendly: the Settings "Paste cookies.txt" mode applies to video-side YouTube too

### Library Maintenance (repair jobs)

- Broken files, duplicate movies, metadata gaps, missing episodes, naming conformance, quality upgrade, watched-cleanup, wishlist audit, movie collections, YouTube ghosts
- Rich findings dashboard with lazy detail, mirrored from the music-side Maintenance standard

### Bulk Editing, Locking & Issues

- **Manage panel** — inline metadata edits with per-field locking, plus **re-identify** (re-file an imported title to a different release through the staging pipeline)
- **Bulk select bar** for mass metadata operations
- **Issues system** — report a problem from the Manage sidebar; an Issues page + nav badge (full music-side parity)

### Server Activity (Tautulli-style monitoring)

- Live Plex/Jellyfin **now-playing** + watch **history** in an app-wide slide-out drawer, plus statistics & graphs
- Gated to Plex/Jellyfin servers (hidden when the active server can't provide it)

### Automations & Dashboard

- A dedicated **video Automations page** — the same drag-and-drop builder, showing only video-owned rows (the music page is untouched)
- A video **event bus** (batch-complete, scan-complete, …) drives the full watchlist → wishlist → download pipeline plus airing refresh, re-enrichment, overlays, collection sync, deep scans, cleanup, and backups
- **Dashboard** — recently-added hero, library/upcoming/stats cards, enrichment-coverage rings, and a combined Studios (Overlay + Collection) admin card

---

## Installation

### Docker (Recommended)

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nezreka/SoulSync/main/docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up -d
# Access at http://localhost:8008
```

### Release Channels

SoulSync publishes two Docker image tracks so you can choose your level of stability.

**Stable — `:latest`** (recommended for most users). Hand-promoted from the `dev` branch to `main` when a batch of changes is ready for release. Published to Docker Hub. Your `docker-compose.yml` pulls this by default — no changes needed.

```bash
docker pull boulderbadgedad/soulsync:latest
```

**Nightly — `:dev`**. Rebuilt every night from the `dev` branch (and on every push to dev). Published to GitHub Container Registry. Gets new features and bug fixes before they reach `:latest`, at the cost of occasional instability as changes settle. Good for early adopters, contributors validating their own merges, and anyone helping shake out bugs on Discord before a stable release.

To switch, edit `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
image: ghcr.io/nezreka/soulsync:dev
```

Then run `docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d`.

Pinned dev builds are also published as `ghcr.io/nezreka/soulsync:dev-YYYYMMDD-<sha>` if you want to stick with an exact known-good snapshot.

**Version-tagged releases** (e.g. `:2.3`, `:2.4`) are permanent tags published on both registries when a stable release is promoted:

```bash
docker pull boulderbadgedad/soulsync:2.4
# or
docker pull ghcr.io/nezreka/soulsync:2.4
```

| You are... | Use |
|---|---|
| A typical user who wants things to work | `:latest` |
| Pinning to a specific version for stability | `:2.3`, `:2.4`, etc. |
| An early adopter who wants new features early and is OK reporting bugs | `:dev` |
| A contributor testing post-merge behavior | `:dev` or a pinned dev build |

### Unraid

SoulSync is available as an Unraid template. Install from Community Applications or manually add the template from:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nezreka/SoulSync/main/templates/soulsync.xml
```

PUID/PGID are exposed in the template — set them to match your Unraid permissions (default: 99/100 for nobody/users).

The template points at `boulderbadgedad/soulsync:latest` (stable) by default. To use the nightly `:dev` channel on Unraid, edit the container's **Repository** field to `ghcr.io/nezreka/soulsync:dev` after installing from the template.

### Python (No Docker)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nezreka/SoulSync
cd SoulSync
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# Build the React WebUI bundle used by the Python server.
# Docker does this automatically; Python installs must do it manually.
cd webui
npm ci
npm run build
cd ..

gunicorn -c gunicorn.conf.py wsgi:application
# Open http://localhost:8008
```

When updating a Python/no-Docker install with `git pull`, rebuild the WebUI before restarting SoulSync:

```bash
cd webui
npm ci
npm run build
cd ..
```

If `webui/static/dist/.vite/manifest.json` is missing or stale, React-owned routes and route handoffs may not load correctly.

**YouTube streaming / music videos** need two extra things on bare-metal installs (Docker bundles both):

- **Deno** — yt-dlp now requires a JavaScript runtime to unlock YouTube formats. Without it, streams and music-video downloads fail with `Requested format is not available`. Install: `winget install DenoLand.Deno` (Windows) or see [deno.com](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/), then restart SoulSync.
- **yt-dlp nightly** — the stable release can lag months behind YouTube changes. If YouTube breaks, update with: `python -m pip install -U --pre "yt-dlp[default]"`

### Local Development

This is only for contributors working on the WebUI with hot reload. Normal Python/no-Docker installs should build once with `npm run build` as shown above, then run only Gunicorn.

For active frontend development, use two terminals so the backend and Vite stay independent:

1. Backend
   ```bash
   python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   gunicorn -c gunicorn.dev.conf.py wsgi:application
   ```
   The dev Gunicorn config watches backend files and restarts the Python server when they change.
2. Frontend
   ```bash
   cd webui
   npm ci
   npm run dev
   ```
   Vite hot reloads the React side when you change webui files.

Run tests separately when needed:

```bash
python -m pytest
```

If you want a convenience launcher, `python dev.py` starts both halves together
on any OS. `./dev.sh` remains available as a Unix shell wrapper.

## Setup Guide

### Prerequisites

- **slskd** running and accessible ([Download](https://github.com/slskd/slskd/releases)) — required for Soulseek downloads
- **Spotify API** credentials ([Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)) — optional but recommended for discovery
- **Media Server** (optional): Plex, Jellyfin, or Navidrome
- **Deno** (Python/no-Docker installs only): JavaScript runtime required by yt-dlp for YouTube streaming/music videos — `winget install DenoLand.Deno` or [deno.com](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/). Docker images bundle it.
- **Deezer ARL token** (optional): For Deezer downloads — get from browser cookies after logging into deezer.com
- **Tidal account** (optional): For Tidal downloads — authenticate via device flow in Settings
- **Qobuz account** (optional): For Qobuz downloads — email/password login in Settings

### Step 1: Set Up slskd

SoulSync talks to slskd through its API. See the [slskd setup guide](https://github.com/slskd/slskd) for API key configuration.

1. Add an API key in slskd's `settings.yml` under `web > authentication > api_keys`
2. Restart slskd
3. Paste the key into SoulSync's Settings → Downloads → Soulseek section

**Configure file sharing in slskd to avoid Soulseek bans.** Set up shared folders at `http://localhost:5030/shares`.

### Step 2: Set Up Spotify API (Optional)

Spotify gives you the best discovery features. Without it, SoulSync falls back to iTunes/Deezer for metadata.

1. Create an app at [developer.spotify.com/dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Add Redirect URI: `http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback`
3. Copy Client ID and Client Secret into SoulSync Settings

More detail in [Support/DOCKER-OAUTH-FIX.md](Support/DOCKER-OAUTH-FIX.md).

### Step 3: Configure SoulSync

Open SoulSync at `http://localhost:8008` and go to Settings.

**Download Source**: Choose your preferred source (Soulseek, Deezer, Tidal, Qobuz, HiFi, Amazon Music, YouTube, or Hybrid)

**Paths**:
- **Input Folder**: Container path to slskd's download folder (e.g., `/app/downloads`)
- **Output Folder**: Where organized music goes (e.g., `/app/Transfer`)
- **Import Folder**: Optional folder for importing existing music (e.g., `/app/Staging`)

**Media Server** (optional): Use your machine's actual IP (not `localhost` — that means inside the container)

### Step 4: Docker Path Mapping

| What | Container Path | Host Path |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| Config | `/app/config` | Your config folder |
| Logs | `/app/logs` | Your logs folder |
| Database | `/app/data` | Named volume (recommended) |
| Input | `/app/downloads` | Same folder slskd downloads to |
| Output | `/app/Transfer` | Where organized music goes |
| Import | `/app/Staging` | Optional folder for importing music |

**Important:** Use a named volume for the database (`soulsync_database:/app/data`). Direct host path mounts to `/app/data` can overwrite Python module files.

## Contributing

### Branch workflow

SoulSync uses a `dev` → `main` flow:

- **`main`** — release branch. `:latest` images auto-build from this. Only receives merges from `dev`.
- **`dev`** — integration branch. Nightly `:dev` images build from here. PRs land here first for validation before being promoted to `main`.
- **Feature branches** — branched from `dev`. PRs target `dev`.

### Opening a PR

1. Fork and clone the repo
2. Branch off `dev`: `git checkout -b fix/your-change dev`
3. Make your changes and commit
4. Push and open a PR against **`dev`** (not `main`)
5. CI (`build-and-test.yml`) runs ruff lint + compile + `python -m pytest` on your branch — wait for green
6. A maintainer reviews and merges

### Running locally

Use the [Local Development](#local-development) section above for the full repo-wide setup and the portable dev launcher.

For web UI work, see [webui/README.md](webui/README.md). It keeps the React-side notes close to the app while this file stays the single place for repo-wide dev instructions.

Ruff config lives in `pyproject.toml`. The ruleset is intentionally lenient — it catches real bugs (undefined names, import shadowing, closure-in-loop) without style nits.

### Reporting bugs / requesting features

Open an issue on GitHub. For user-side support, the Discord community is the fastest place to ask.
