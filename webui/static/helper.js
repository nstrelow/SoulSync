// VERSION MODAL — curated highlight reel
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// `WHATS_NEW` above is the per-version detailed log used by the "What's New"
// helper-popover panel — short one-liners, internal page links, every entry
// shown on every browse-back through versions.
//
// `VERSION_MODAL_SECTIONS` (this block) is the curated highlight reel shown
// when the user clicks the version button in the sidebar. It's NOT a
// mechanical view of WHATS_NEW — it's editorial curation: bigger-picture
// sections, bullet-list expansions, optional "usage" hints at the bottom.
// Some sections aggregate across multiple WHATS_NEW entries ("Recent Fixes",
// "Earlier in v2.3"); some don't have a 1:1 WHATS_NEW counterpart at all.
//
// Both consts live here so a release editor only opens one file. At release
// time:
//   1. Add the per-version block to `WHATS_NEW` (one entry per shipped item).
//   2. Derive the current release highlights in `VERSION_MODAL_SECTIONS`
//      from pr_description.md, using the same shipped changes.
//   3. Keep one brief "Earlier in X.Y.Z" summary instead of a growing backlog.
//
// Section shape: { title, description, features: [bullet strings],
//                  usage_note?: 'optional hint shown at the bottom' }
