/**
 * The discover page's section order, as data.
 *
 * ── Why this file exists instead of a port of _reorderDiscoverSections ──────
 *
 * The vanilla authored its sections in code-order, and several injected
 * themselves into a mid-page sub-container, so the page rendered as a jumble.
 * It fixed that AFTER the fact: `_reorderDiscoverSections()` walked a LAYOUT
 * array and physically moved ~20 already-rendered DOM nodes into place with
 * appendChild, on every load and every navigation, unwrapping its own previous
 * two-column rows first so repeat runs did not nest or duplicate them.
 *
 * React renders in declaration order, so none of that machinery is needed. What
 * MUST survive is the outcome — the order, and the pairing rule — so the order
 * is preserved here verbatim and the pairing rule becomes a pure function that
 * can actually be tested. That is the whole of `_reorderDiscoverSections`'s
 * observable behaviour, minus the DOM churn.
