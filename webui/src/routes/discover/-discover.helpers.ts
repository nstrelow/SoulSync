/**
 * Pure helpers ported from webui/static/discover.js.
 *
 * Every function here is a pure function of its arguments — no DOM, no fetch,
 * no module state — which is what lets `-discover.helpers.differential.test.ts`
 * lift the REAL vanilla functions out of discover.js and assert this port is
 * byte-identical to them.
 *
 * ── The escapeHtml difference, which is deliberate ──────────────────────────
 *
 * The vanilla reason-strings call `escapeHtml()` internally, because the
 * vanilla drops them straight into `innerHTML`. React escapes on render, so a
 * 1:1 port would DOUBLE-escape: a library containing `AC/DC & Friends` would
 * literally show `AC/DC &amp; Friends` on screen.
 *
 * So the ported versions return RAW text and let React do the escaping — the
 * correct React translation of the same intent. The differential test proves
 * they still match by supplying `escapeHtml = (s) => s` to the vanilla, which
 * makes the vanilla return raw text too. Identical logic, escaping moved to the
 * one place that should own it.
