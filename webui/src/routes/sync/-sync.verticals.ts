/**
 * The ten source verticals, built from ONE table rather than ten hand-written
 * hook calls.
 *
 * kettui's fourth observation is that similar things get reimplemented per
 * feature instead of sharing an abstraction, and ten near-identical
 * `useSourceVertical(SYNC_SOURCES.x, …)` calls at a page's top level is exactly
 * that shape: ten places to forget an option, ten places to update when the
 * vertical contract changes, and no way to tell that an eleventh source was
 * added and missed. The registry below is the abstraction — the table is the
 * source of truth and the page reads a map out of it.
 *
 * TEN, not sixteen: several tabs share a vertical. Last.fm Radio rides
 * ListenBrainz's machinery (same MB-track shape), Deezer-link rides Deezer's,
 * and the three URL-import tabs each have their own. `ytmusic` is the one
 * exception in the other direction — it's its OWN vertical (a real account
 * with real discovery/sync state) even though it shares youtube's worker and
 * result shape; see `-sync.sources.ts`. The tab count and the vertical count
 * are different numbers and conflating them is how a tab ends up with a
 * vertical that belongs to something else.
 *
 * HOOK ORDER IS SAFE because `SYNC_VERTICAL_IDS` is a frozen module constant:
 * the same ids in the same order on every render, which is all the rules of
 * hooks require. A test pins it against SYNC_SOURCES so a source added to the
 * table cannot silently skip the registry.
