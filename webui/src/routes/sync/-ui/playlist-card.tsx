/**
 * The playlist card — artwork first, state carried quietly by the artwork.
 *
 * What this replaces: a row with the art tile, the name, an optional original
 * name, a meta row of up to five bordered chips (source badge, track count,
 * mirrored-ago, a discovery ratio, a coloured phase line, an export status),
 * then six icon-only buttons and a schedule select. Fourteen elements at the
 * same visual weight, which is why it read as a wall of controls rather than a
 * library.
 *
 * THE RESTING CARD IS ART, A NAME, ONE LINE AND A SCHEDULE. Everything else is
 * either gone or waits for a hover.
 *
 * State rides on the COVER rather than beside it:
 *   * a ring on the artwork's corner, its arc the coverage, its number the
 *     percentage — red for a failed run, pulsing for one in flight;
 *   * the cover desaturates while something is wrong, so an incomplete card
 *     reads differently even out of focus.
 *
 * A healthy card gets NEITHER. That is the point: a ring on every card would be
 * forty of them announcing that nothing is wrong, the same mistake as a full
 * green progress bar on a finished row. Problems sort to the front instead
 * (librarySortedRows), so nothing needs to shout to be found.
