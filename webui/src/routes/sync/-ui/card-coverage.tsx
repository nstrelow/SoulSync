/**
 * One coverage renderer for every card on this page.
 *
 * The page grew four ways of saying the same thing. Three of them lived in
 * card-progress.tsx alone — the sync writer's `♪ 20 / ✓ 14 / ✗ 2 / (80%)`, the
 * check-note pair `✓ 14 / ♪ 20` with no failures and no percentage, and the
 * unconditional slash-text line — and ListenBrainz painted a fourth. Which one
 * you saw depended on which tab you were standing on, for the same underlying
 * fact.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — this unifies PRESENTATION ONLY. Every number still comes from the
 * function that always produced it (syncCardCounts, checkNoteCounts,
 * slashTextProgressLine's arithmetic, lbCardProgressLine), because the formulas
 * genuinely differ and that difference is real, not drift:
 *
 *   discovery percentage = matched / total
 *   sync percentage      = (matched + failed) / total     <- counts failures as done
 *
 * So `percentage` is passed IN rather than derived here. A renderer that
 * recomputed it would quietly change what the sync line means.
 *
 * The bar is the better fact — it carries the total as well as the win, which
 * is the argument that took the redundant download chip off the dashboard's
 * sync row. The failure count survives as its own chip because nothing else on
 * the card conveys it and it is the only number here you would act on.
