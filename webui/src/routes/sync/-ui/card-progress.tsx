/**
 * The playlist card's progress line for the URL-import and account
 * verticals. NOT every vertical: the ListenBrainz/Last.fm cards render
 * lbCardProgressLine (-sync.lb-tabs.ts), whose sync percentage is
 * matched/total — real parity, sync-listenbrainz.js 271, not a drift to
 * unify away — and the SoulSync Discovery tab paints its own result line.
 *
 * The vanilla painted this element from two different writers and the second
 * is easy to miss: updateXCardProgress writes the DISCOVERY line (tidal
 * 961-966, deezer's check-note twin), and updateXCardSyncProgress writes a
 * different SYNC line (tidal 1159-1197, qobuz 2315-2348) whose percentage is
 * (matched+failed)/total, not matched/total. The sync writer only paints when
 * total_tracks > 0 and otherwise leaves the discovery line standing, so the
 * element's content is: sync numbers once a sync reports any, else the
 * discovery numbers, else empty.
 *
 * Which discovery format a source uses is the drift the config table already
 * encodes (SourceVerticalConfig.ux.cardProgressFormat) — read it here rather
 * than re-deciding per tab.
