/**
 * The Mirrored Playlists tab (stats-automations.js 500-656 + 1175-1205 +
 * 2023-2042, auto-sync.js 2377-2404; markup at index.html's
 * mirrored-tab-content).
 *
 * Mirrored is the odd vertical — see -sync.mirrored.ts for why none of the
 * shared card/phase machinery applies here.
 *
 * DECLARED DIVERGENCES
 * - Rename uses a real input row, NOT window.prompt (auto-sync.js 2381). The
 *   repo forbids the native dialogs; Escape/Cancel is the `null` return the
 *   vanilla checked for, and a blank value still clears the alias.
 * - The TRACKS detail modal is PORTED (mirrored-detail-modal.tsx), not adopted
 *   like the pools. Its Discover button calls openYouTubeDiscoveryModal, which
 *   the flip deletes, so adoption would break its primary action; three of its
 *   other buttons already have React implementations here. The vanilla
 *   openMirroredPlaylistModal STAYS for auto-sync.js's three callers and
 *   shared-helpers.js, and retires with the auto-sync board phase.
 * - Card clicks open the React DiscoveryModal for every non-fresh phase; the
 *   vanilla's downloading/download_complete arms reopened the vanilla ENGINE
 *   modal through the script-scoped activeDownloadProcesses registry, which
 *   React cannot reach (the P5a/P5b pattern).
 * - The phase line is ONE derived renderer; the vanilla's three writers
 *   disagree (documented in -sync.mirrored.ts).
 * - Export (📤), Auto-Sync and the 🔗 source-ref edit own their controllers
 *   outright; this tab supplies no handler props beyond the discovery-modal
 *   opener.
 * - The two POOL modals are ADOPTED, not reimplemented. They are app-level
 *   overlays: the Tools page opens the Discovery Pool through the same
 *   window.openDiscoveryPoolModal seam (routes/tools/-ui/launcher-cards.tsx),
 *   and globals.d.ts records them as modals that stay vanilla. The header
 *   buttons call the globals; the flip must NOT delete them from
 *   stats-automations.js.
 * - The 🔗 editor is a modal, NOT window.prompt (auto-sync.js 2414) — the same
 *   repo rule the rename follows.
 * - DEFERRED, not dropped: the per-card quality-profile select (600-602) and
 *   its hydrate (645-650). It needs the profiles api + the hydration protocol
 *   that no React sync surface has yet — the discovery-modal footer's copy of
 *   the same control is deferred for the same reason (organize-toggle.tsx).
 *   row.quality_profile_id is carried on the row type ready for it.
