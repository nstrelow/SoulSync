 * Sync history — the pure half.
 *
 * The vanilla modal (wishlist-tools.js 3907-4310) built its rows by string
 * concatenation and drove its live progress by writing into six ids per row.
 * Everything here is the part that DECIDES: which entries belong on this
 * screen, what the tabs say, which of two very different re-sync paths an entry
 * takes, and what a poll payload means. The rendering and the fetching live
 * elsewhere, so all of this is testable without a DOM.
 *
 * The single most important function is `syncHistoryResyncKind`. Re-syncing a
 * Discover row and re-syncing a Spotify row are not variations on one action —
 * one opens the download modal, the other starts a server sync and polls it.
 * Picking wrong does not fail loudly, it does the wrong thing successfully.
