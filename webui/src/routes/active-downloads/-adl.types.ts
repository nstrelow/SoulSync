 *   HISTORY rows    (is_persistent_history: true) have created_at and
 *                   file_path; they have NO history_id, retry_info or
 *                   retry_trigger, and their task_id is `history-<id>`.
 *
 * That split is exactly why verifHistoryId has two branches, and why the
 * unverified detail panel shows "File"/"Downloaded" for some rows and not
 * others. Typing them as one always-present shape would hide that.
