/**
 * Where the episode row's spare width goes.
 *
 * Three attempts, and the first two each traded one problem for another:
 *
 * 1. The row grid gave its TEXT column the 1fr, so every extra pixel of screen
 *    went into the description and shoved the action buttons to the far right
 *    edge - most of a screen away from the episode they belong to.
 * 2. Capping the whole page fixed the distance but centred the hero, which read
 *    as the page having shrunk. A full-bleed backdrop wants its content anchored
 *    to the artwork.
 * 3. Left-anchoring the capped body fixed that, and left a dead band down the
 *    right of every list instead.
 *
 * The fix belongs in the ROW: cap the text column and pack the tracks left, so
 * the buttons sit beside their episode and the page keeps the full width it was
 * given.
 *
 * NOTE ON WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT DO. jsdom does not lay out and this
 * environment has no Chromium, so nothing here MEASURES anything - it pins the
 * declarations that have to agree. A regression fence, not proof.
