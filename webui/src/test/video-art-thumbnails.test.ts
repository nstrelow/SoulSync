/**
 * Video grids have to ask for a THUMBNAIL, not the original.
 *
 * `/api/video/poster/...` returns the full-size art when no `?w=` is given, and
 * Plex's originals are around 2000x3000. The browser decodes one of those to
 * ~24MB of bitmap and then scales it into a 158px card. Sixty cards is over a
 * gigabyte of texture behind a grid of thumbnails, which is why Boulder's
 * watchlist took most of a second to repaint a hover.
 *
 * The wishlist page sized its images; the watchlist and the detail page's
 * season rail did not. These run the REAL helper out of each file - a
 * source-level "it says ?w=" check would pass just as happily on a helper that
 * had stopped working.
