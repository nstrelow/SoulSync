    Issue #572 (rhwc): Navidrome has no API for setting an artist
    image — it reads `artist.jpg` from the artist's folder during
    library scans. SoulSync's `update_artist_poster` for Navidrome
    is a NO-OP today. This endpoint closes the gap by:

    1. Resolving the artist's folder on disk via any of their albums'
       tracks (`_resolve_library_file_path` handles Docker mount
       translation + the same library-path probes #558 settled on)
    2. Fetching an artist photo URL from the configured metadata source
       priority chain (Spotify → Deezer → ... already wired through
       `core.metadata_service.get_artist_image_url`)
    3. Downloading the image bytes and writing `<artist>/artist.jpg`
       atomically via the pure helpers in `core/library/artist_image.py`
    4. Triggering a Navidrome library scan so the file gets picked
       up immediately

    Request body (JSON, all optional):
        - ``image_url`` — explicit URL to use, bypassing metadata
          source resolution (useful for "use this exact photo" UX)
        - ``overwrite`` — when True, replace existing `artist.jpg`
          (default False respects user-supplied files)
        - ``source_override`` — pin the metadata source for URL
          resolution (e.g. ``"deezer"``)
