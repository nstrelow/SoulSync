"""Soulseek chat API — rooms + private messages, proxied through slskd.

Side-neutral (the Chat page is mounted in BOTH the music and video sidebars),
so paths are absolute /api/chat/* and the blueprint registers with no prefix —
deliberately NOT under /api/video, whose permission gate would 403 music-only
profiles.

Permission model: any signed-in profile can READ (the browser never sees the
slskd API key — everything proxies through here). SENDING speaks as the one
shared Soulseek account, so it's admin-only unless the admin opts members in
via ``soulseek.chat_member_send``.

The community room (``soulseek.chat_room``, default 'SoulSync' — Soulseek room
names are CASE-SENSITIVE and that's the real community room) is auto-joined
on demand: slskd room joins don't survive its restarts, so the room hydrate
re-joins whenever slskd reports us absent — idempotent, one extra call only
when actually needed.
