"""Video-side download SETTINGS (isolated).

Persists the video download configuration in video.db's ``video_settings`` KV
table — fully separate from the music ``soulseek.*`` paths so the two libraries
never share a folder or collide — plus the queue/history/blocklist endpoints the
Downloads page reads. The fulfillment engine itself lives in the wishlist drain
(``core/automation/handlers/video_process_wishlist``) + ``download_monitor``.

Folders:
  - INPUT (download) folder is SHARED with the music side — it's the same
    ``config_manager`` key the music Download Settings use (``soulseek.download_path``),
    so changing it on either side changes both (one physical download dir, simpler
    Docker mounts). We only READ/WRITE that shared key; no music code is touched.
  - OUTPUT (library) folders are video-specific and live in video.db, one per type:
      ``movies_path`` / ``tv_path`` / ``youtube_path``.
  The engine routes a finished download to the library path matching its type. (Legacy
  single video ``transfer_path`` is migrated into ``movies_path`` on first read.)

Connection settings that are genuinely SHARED with music (the slskd instance, the
torrent/usenet clients, Prowlarr indexers) are NOT stored here — those live in the
music config_manager and are surfaced on the shared Indexers tab + shared slskd
block (a deliberate shared boundary, since they're one physical resource).
