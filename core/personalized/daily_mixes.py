"""Daily Mixes - taste-clustered blends of owned + discovery tracks.

the spotify feature, done with the one advantage spotify doesn't have
here: the library is local. each mix is ~80% tracks the user owns
(instantly playable) and ~20% discovery tracks from the cluster's
similar artists (one click from download).

clustering: recency-weighted top artists from listening_history are
greedily grouped by similarity edges (similar_artists, resolved through
SOURCE ids - never artists.id, see the id-smear bug) and shared genres.
each cluster becomes one mix, regenerated daily (deterministic per day,
different tomorrow).

storage: the whole payload - full track dicts, not pool ids - goes into
discovery_curated_playlists under 'daily_mixes_v2'. pool rotation can
never shrink these (the fresh-tape hydration lesson).
