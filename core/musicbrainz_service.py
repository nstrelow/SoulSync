        Uses `search_artist(strict=False)` — a bare query, which hits MB's
        alias/sortname indexes and is what makes a romanised or cross-script
        name resolvable at all (the strict `artist:"..."` field alone would
        not find it, same #586 pattern as `lookup_artist_aliases`).

        Deliberately conservative: this MBID gets pinned onto a recording
        search and the result cached, so a wrong resolution here is a wrong
        recording match cached for the row's TTL. Accepted only when exactly
        ONE result's name or alias equals the query (case-insensitive) and
        that result scores >= 90. Neither a relevance gap nor the top score
        alone is evidence: MusicBrainz scales the best hit of any bare query
        to 100, so a name it has never heard of still comes back as
        `[unknown]` at 100 with a 78-point runner-up — and `[unknown]` has
        dozens of recordings called "Yesterday" to pin a wrong title onto.
        The same rule refuses a name several artists share outright (four
        MB artists are literally "Nirvana"); the plain search has to settle
        those, and it already does when the credit matches.

        Cached under its own entity_type so this costs one round trip per
        artist name, not one per track — but ONLY when MusicBrainz actually
        answered. `search_artist` is fail-soft by default and collapses a
        transient timeout/5xx into the same `[]` it returns for a genuine
        "nobody by that name"; caching that as a negative would silence this
        whole fallback for the row's TTL off the back of one outage.
        `raise_on_error=True` tells the two apart, and the raise is left to

        artist record. Pull them so SoulSync can recognise that
        `澤野弘之` and `Hiroyuki Sawano` refer to the same artist.

        Issue #586 — for some artists MB's CANONICAL `name` is the
        non-Latin spelling (e.g. `Дмитрий Яблонский`) while the
        Latin spelling lives in `aliases` — but the inverse also
        happens, where the Latin canonical name has the Cyrillic in
        aliases. Either way the canonical `name` and `sort-name` are
        themselves valid alternate spellings for matching purposes,
        so include them alongside the explicit alias entries.

        Returns the deduplicated list of alias `name` strings, or **None**

        an empty list means "MusicBrainz lists no alternate spelling", None
