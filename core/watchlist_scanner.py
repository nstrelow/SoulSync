          - seeds resolve through the library catalogue as (provider, id)
            pairs, so an artist you play but do not WATCH still finds its
            similarity edges, and a deezer id never matches an itunes one;

            fills two shelves cannot leave a third from three weeks ago
            standing beside them;
          - a failed run stores a failure marker and leaves the last good
            generation in place, instead of replacing it with an empty

        tracks, derived from your most-played artists + the similar_artists graph.

        The ranking lives in core.discovery.listening_recommendations (pure + tested); this only
        gathers inputs — all already in the DB, NO new network — and stores the result under NEW
        metadata/curated keys. Fully self-contained and guarded: any failure logs and returns, so
        it can never disturb the scan.

        "Best in class" generation (the elevation over the first cut):
          • Seeds are recency-weighted — recent plays boost lifetime favourites so the picks
            track what you're into NOW, not just all-time totals.
          • The ranker is fed the RAW per-seed edges (one row per seed→similar), so an artist
            similar to several of your seeds accumulates real CONSENSUS — the old code fed the
            name-collapsed ``get_top_similar_artists`` query, which flattened every similar to a
            single seed (consensus could never fire). The raw edges also carry ``similarity_rank``,
            so a seed's CLOSEST matches outweigh its long-tail ones.
          • ``source_artist_id`` is a SOURCE id (Spotify/iTunes/Deezer/MusicBrainz), so the id→name
            map is built from the artists' source-id columns, NOT the internal row id (the first
            cut keyed it by ``artists.id`` and resolved nothing — the feature produced 0 recs).
        Phase-1 candidate tracks still come from the discovery pool (like BYLT); a later phase
        swaps in a direct top-tracks fetch for richer coverage.
