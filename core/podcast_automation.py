"""Podcast Automation Service — background monitoring, auto-download, and retention management.

Features:
- Periodic or on-demand scanning of watchlisted podcasts.
- Ingests RSS feeds via PodcastClient and updates episode counts and scan timestamps.
- Automatically queues downloads for newly discovered episodes if auto_download is enabled.
- Avoids re-downloading episodes already downloaded or tracked in history/download tables.
- Applies retention policies: deletes downloaded audio files on disk and marks records
  as pruned when they exceed the configured retention_days.
