"""Wing It stubs — the stand-in a track gets when discovery finds no catalogue match.

When a provider search returns nothing confident enough, discovery stores a stub
``matched_data`` built from the *source's own* artist/title so the track still
appears in the mirror and still flows through the download pipeline. The stub is
identified by an id carrying the ``wing_it_`` prefix.

The id used to be ``f"wing_it_{hash(f'{artist}_{track}') % 100000}"``. ``hash()`` on
a str is salted per interpreter (PEP 456), so the same track got a different id in
every process — and ``% 100000`` collides freely on top of that. A stub id is written
to ``mirrored_playlist_tracks.extra_data.matched_data.id`` and outlives the process
that produced it, so it has to be reproducible to identify anything at all.
