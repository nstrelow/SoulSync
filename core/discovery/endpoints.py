"""Generic, source-agnostic helpers for the playlist-discovery route layer.

The discovery/sync endpoints in ``web_server.py`` were copy-pasted once per
source (Tidal, Deezer, Qobuz, Spotify-public, iTunes-link, YouTube,
ListenBrainz, Beatport). The per-source copies differ only by a source label
string and which ``<source>_discovery_states`` global they read. This module
lifts the source-agnostic pieces into importable, unit-testable helpers so the
route functions become thin wrappers — exactly preserving behavior (1:1).

Each helper is lifted verbatim from its web_server.py counterpart; any
per-source quirk that genuinely differs (e.g. Beatport's distinct result
shape) is intentionally NOT routed through here and stays in its own function.
