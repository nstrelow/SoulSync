"""Helpers for Fix-popup manual match persistence.

When the user manually fixes a mirrored-playlist discovery via the Fix
popup, two questions land at the web_server route layer that are easier
to test in isolation:

1. *Which metadata source did the manual match come from?* — the popup
   cascade queries the user's primary source first, then Spotify /
   Deezer / iTunes / MusicBrainz as fallbacks; each search endpoint
   stamps `source` on its rows but the MBID-paste lookup uses a lean
   flat shape that doesn't carry it. `derive_manual_match_provider`
   collapses the fallback chain into a single string.

2. *Should the discovery layer re-run for this track when the current
   active provider differs from the cached one?* — re-running silently
   overwrites the user's deliberate pick with whatever the auto-search
   ranks first, so manual matches are exempt regardless of provider
   drift. `is_drifted_for_redo` encapsulates the decision.

3. *Should the Playlist Pipeline pre-scan (re)discover this track at all?*
   — `should_rediscover` encapsulates that gate, with the manual match
   checked FIRST so a leftover Wing It flag can't override the user's pick.

    This is the gate the Playlist Pipeline pre-scan runs over every mirrored

    authoritative and is checked FIRST.

    ``extra_data`` is *merged* on save (see ``update_mirrored_track_extra_data``),
    so a track that was a Wing It stub and is then manually fixed still carries
    ``wing_it_fallback: True`` alongside the new ``manual_match: True``. The old
