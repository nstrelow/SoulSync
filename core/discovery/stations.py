"""Recommended Stations - artist radio cards from the listening history.

spotify's "recommended stations" row: your heaviest recent artists as
one-click radio. ours plays through the artist-radio seam that already
exists (startArtistRadioById -> the library's own tracks + similarity
refill), so a station starts in under a second with zero downloads.

the "With X and Y" subtitles come from similar_artists, resolved through
SOURCE ids (never artists.id - the id-smear lesson), and then VERIFIED: a name
only earns "With" if that artist actually has playable tracks in the library.
everything else is offered as a weaker "Related artists" label, because the
queue is built by core/radio/selection.py from genre and mood tiers and never
promised a specific companion.

a station also has a finite side. build_station_snapshot returns up to forty
library tracks for the seed, stored so the selection cannot move under an open
dialog, and it never touches playback: no queue, no player, no audio.
