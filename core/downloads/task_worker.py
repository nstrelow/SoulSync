"""Per-task download worker.

Runs as a background thread (one per task) that:
1. Tries source-reuse (use the batch's last good slskd peer if available)
2. Tries staging-match (file already in staging folder, no download needed)
3. Generates smart search queries via the matching engine + legacy fallbacks
4. Iterates queries sequentially against the soulseek client
5. For each query: validates results, attempts download with fallback candidates
6. If hybrid mode: falls back to remaining sources (youtube/tidal/qobuz/hifi/deezer_dl)
7. On total failure: marks task not_found + records search diagnostics
8. On any uncaught exception: marks failed + emergency worker-slot recovery

Lifted verbatim from web_server.py's `_download_track_worker`. The helpers
this calls into (try_source_reuse, store_batch_source, try_staging_match,
get_valid_candidates, attempt_download_with_candidates, on_download_completed,
recover_worker_slot) are passed via `TaskWorkerDeps` since each is itself
a large web_server.py helper that will get its own lift in subsequent PRs.
