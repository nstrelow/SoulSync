"""Master worker for the missing-tracks download workflow.

`run_full_missing_tracks_process(batch_id, playlist_id, tracks_json, deps)` is
the single 580-line worker that orchestrates the entire pipeline:

  1. PHASE 1 — Analysis: per-track DB ownership check, with album fast path
     (lookup album by name+artist, match tracks within it) plus a
     MusicBrainz release-cache preflight so per-track post-processing all
     uses the same release MBID (prevents Navidrome album splits).
  2. Wishlist removal for tracks already in the library.
  3. Explicit-content filter.
  4. PHASE 2 transition — if nothing missing, mark batch complete, update
     per-source playlist phases, kick auto-wishlist completion handler.
  5. Soulseek album pre-flight — search for a complete album folder before
     falling back to track-by-track search, cache the source for reuse.
  6. Wishlist album grouping — derive per-album disc counts and resolve
     ONE artist context per album so collab albums don't fold-split.
  7. Task creation with explicit album/artist context injection.
  8. Hand off to download monitor + start_next_batch_of_downloads.

Lifted verbatim from web_server.py. Wide dependency surface (config, MB
caches, Soulseek client, source-page state dicts, multiple helper funcs)
all injected via `MasterDeps`.
