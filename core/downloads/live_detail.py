"""Live per-task detail for the download status payloads (#1156).

The engine has always known where a task is searching, what it found and who
it's pulling from — the task dict carries it, the status builders dropped it.
This module is the one place that turns those private fields into the payload
both UIs render, so the modal and the downloads page can never drift apart.

Everything here is best-effort decoration: a missing field degrades to an
absent key, never an error — the status frame must survive any task shape.
