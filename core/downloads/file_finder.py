"""Robust completed-download file finder.

Walks a download directory (and optional transfer directory) to find
the local file matching an API-reported remote filename. Handles:

- Arbitrary subdirectory layouts (slskd flat / username-prefixed /
  remote-tree-preserved). Pre-extract callers in the Soulseek
  album-bundle path tried three hard-coded candidate paths and
  silently failed on layouts that didn't match — see issue #715
  (Billy Ocean album task fails after slskd finishes downloading
  release). The per-track flow already used a recursive walk and
  worked; the bundle path didn't, so users on common slskd configs
  with username-prefixed downloads saw bundles time out 22 minutes
  after slskd reported every transfer Completed.
- slskd dedup suffix ``_<10-or-more-digit-timestamp>`` appended when
  a file with the same basename already exists.
- YouTube / Tidal encoded filename format ``id||title`` — the
  ``||`` half is the human title and used for matching.
- Multiple files sharing a basename — disambiguates by counting
  how many remote-path directory components appear in the local
  path.

This was lifted verbatim from ``web_server._find_completed_file_robust``
so both the per-track download poll AND the Soulseek album-bundle
poll go through one finder. Pre-extract the bundle path probed
three hard-coded candidates only, which is why bundle downloads
on slskd setups with username-prefixed download dirs silently
timed out (#715).
