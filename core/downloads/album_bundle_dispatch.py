"""Album-bundle dispatch for torrent / usenet single-source downloads.

Lifted from ``run_full_missing_tracks_process`` so the master
worker doesn't carry a 90-line inline branch and so the gate logic
can be unit-tested in isolation.

The gate fires only when ALL conditions hold:

- Batch is an album-context download (``is_album_download`` flag).
- Active download source is ``torrent``, ``usenet``, or ``soulseek``.
  In hybrid mode the caller may pass one source from the consecutive
  release-capable prefix as an override; the caller preserves source order.
- Both album-name and artist-name are populated in batch context.
- The resolved plugin exposes ``download_album_to_staging``.

When the gate engages it runs the plugin synchronously (the master
worker is already on a thread-pool executor) and mirrors the
plugin's lifecycle payloads into the batch state so the Downloads
page can render meaningful progress before per-track tasks exist.

Return semantics: ``True`` means the gate handled the batch — the
master worker should stop and not run per-track analysis. ``False``
means the gate didn't engage (or engaged-and-fell-back) — caller
continues the normal per-track flow.

The ``BatchStateAccess`` Protocol exists so this module doesn't
import ``download_batches`` from runtime_state directly. The
caller (master worker) injects accessors so this module stays
testable without touching live runtime state.
