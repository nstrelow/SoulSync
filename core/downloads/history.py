"""Sync history recording.

Two write paths: `record_sync_history_start` runs when a batch is
submitted (creates or updates a sync_history row), and
`record_sync_history_completion` runs when a batch finishes (updates
counts + per-track results). Plus `detect_sync_source` which derives
the source label from the playlist_id prefix.

Every write is wrapped in a try/except — sync history is best-effort,
a failure here must never break a real download.
