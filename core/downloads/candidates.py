"""Candidate fallback download logic.

`attempt_download_with_candidates(task_id, candidates, track, batch_id, deps)`
is the function the search/match pipeline calls once it has a sorted list of
Soulseek candidates for a track. It walks validated candidates in
correctness-band / peer-availability order and starts the first one that:

1. Hasn't been tried for this task already (`used_sources` dedup).
2. Isn't blacklisted (user-flagged bad match).
3. Doesn't trigger a cancellation race (checked at three points).

When a candidate accepts:

- Stores rich post-processing context in `matched_downloads_context` keyed by
  `make_context_key(username, filename)` — clean Spotify metadata, album
  context (real or synthesized), `is_album_download` flag, batch/task IDs.
- For tracks with clean Spotify data, resolves track_number / disc_number
  from (1) track_info → (2) track object → (3) Spotify API call, with album
  metadata backfilled from the API response when local context is incomplete.
- Updates the task with the assigned `download_id`, falls through with a
  "searching" reset on failure so the next attempt finds a clean state.

On cancellation mid-download, attempts to cancel the active Soulseek transfer
and notifies the lifecycle via `on_download_completed(success=False)` so the
worker slot frees up.

Lifted verbatim from web_server.py. Wide dependency surface
(download_orchestrator, spotify_client, lifecycle callback, context-key helper,
status updater, DB) all injected via `CandidatesDeps`.

    It fills in only when the user asked for a version (Settings → prefer a
    version) AND the matching engine confirmed this file is that version OF
    THIS SONG. Carrying the label is not enough — "Song Two (Extended Mix)" can
    still be walked to as a fallback candidate, and loosening the import gates
    for a file the preference never chose is exactly the wrong trade.

    Downstream it does two jobs, both because the file is deliberately a
    different recording than the source describes:
      - the source's duration belongs to the other cut (an extended mix runs
        minutes past the radio edit Spotify listed), so integrity would
        quarantine a file we went looking for;
      - AcoustID's version gate compares the source title's version against the
        fingerprinted recording's, and would call the difference a wrong song.

    ``duration_ms`` is the length the peer advertised, which still catches a
    truncated transfer. None means the peer advertised nothing, so there's no
    honest reference and the duration leg gets skipped rather than guessed at.

    Pure helper. No I/O, no config reads — the caller passes the preference in.
