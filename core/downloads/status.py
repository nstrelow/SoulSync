"""Batch + unified download status helpers.

`build_batch_status_data` is the per-batch payload formatter shared by:
- /api/playlists/<batch_id>/download_status (single batch)
- /api/download_status/batch (multiple batches in one call)

It's NOT pure read-only — it has a safety valve that mutates task state
when slskd reports terminal-but-stuck downloads, and it submits the
post-processing worker when slskd reports 'Succeeded' or when a stuck
file is recovered. Those side effects are preserved exactly.

`build_unified_downloads_response` powers /api/downloads/all — flattens
all tasks across batches into one sorted list with per-row metadata for
the centralized Downloads page.

Lifted verbatim from web_server.py. Dependencies that touch the live
runtime (config, file finder, post-processing submitter, transfer cache)
are passed via `StatusDeps` so the module is web_server-import-free.
