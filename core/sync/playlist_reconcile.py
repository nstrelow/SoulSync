"""Reconcile a source playlist against a media-server playlist (pure).

Lifted verbatim from the inline three-pass matcher in
``web_server.get_server_playlist_tracks`` so it can be unit-tested and so the
two #768 fixes live in importable, covered code:

  Pass 0  user-confirmed overrides (``sync_match_cache``), applied first.
  Pass 1  exact normalized-title match, gated on artist agreement — or on
          duration corroboration when the artist strings share nothing
          (#1164: title alone pinned "XO" by John Mayer to "XO" by Eden
          Project at 100%).
  Pass 2  fuzzy match on ``"artist title"`` (SequenceMatcher >= 0.75).
  Extra   server tracks no source claimed -> ``match_status='extra'``.

Two bug fixes over the original inline version:

* #768 Bug A — the source side is YouTube/streaming-shaped (title
  ``"Artist - Song"``, artist ``"Official Artist"``). The original passes
  compared the raw title, so ``"Arctic Monkeys - Do I Wanna Know?"`` never
  matched the library's ``"Do I Wanna Know?"`` and the track showed as
  unmatched while its server copy showed as an orphan "extra". We now also try
  the canonicalized source title/artist (see ``core.text.source_title``).

* #768 Bug B — the original built the per-source ``src_entry`` WITHOUT
  ``source_track_id``, so the editor UI never received it; "Find & add" then
  posted an empty id and the manual match was never persisted (it reverted to
  "extra" on reload, and re-adding duplicated the track). ``src_entry`` now
  carries ``source_track_id``.

Pure, no I/O. ``override_pairs`` (``{source_idx: server_idx}``) is computed by
the caller via ``core.sync.match_overrides.resolve_match_overrides`` so the DB
lookup stays out of this module.
