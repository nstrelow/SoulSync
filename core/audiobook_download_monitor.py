"""Watch grabbed audiobooks to completion and file them into the library.

Without this a grab is fire-and-forget: the download client is fetching
something the app has no idea about, so nothing ever notices it finished and the
book never reaches the library.

``process_download`` is PURE — every piece of I/O is injected — so the state
machine can be tested without a download client, a filesystem or a network. The
thread around it is a thin polling loop.

MUSIC-SAFE, in the same sense core/video/client_download.py is: it polls the
SHARED torrent/usenet adapters and reuses ``resolve_reported_save_path`` from
the music download plugins, importing and calling them, never modifying them.
Nothing here touches the music batches, worker pool, wishlist or database.
