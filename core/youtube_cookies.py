"""YouTube cookie options for yt-dlp — a browser store *or* a pasted cookies.txt.

Settings → YouTube offers two ways to authenticate yt-dlp:

* a **browser dropdown** (Chrome/Firefox/…) → yt-dlp ``cookiesfrombrowser``, which
  reads a logged-in browser's cookie store *on the same machine as SoulSync*. Great
  for local installs, useless on a headless server / Docker box (no browser there).
* a **"Paste cookies.txt"** mode → yt-dlp ``cookiefile``, a Netscape-format cookie
  file the user exports (e.g. with a "Get cookies.txt LOCALLY" extension) and pastes
  in. This is the only path that works for server/Docker users, and it's what makes
  *private* playlists — a user's "Liked Music" (``list=LM``) — actually visible.

This module centralises the precedence and the pasted-file validation so the live
opts (:func:`build_youtube_cookie_opts`) and the settings-save write agree, and so
the seam is unit-testable without I/O. The web layer owns *where* the file lives
(next to ``config.json``); this module only decides the opts and validates content.
