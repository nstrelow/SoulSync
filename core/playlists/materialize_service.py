"""Build a playlist's materialized folder from a FINISHED organize-by-playlist
download batch.

The batch already carries the real on-disk location of every resolved track:

  - **owned** tracks → ``analysis_results[*]['matched_file_path']`` (the library
    matcher's result, captured during analysis), and
  - **downloaded** tracks → ``download_tasks[tid]['final_file_path']`` (where the
    import landed).

So this is pure stitching + filesystem work: **no re-matching, no source-ID
lookup, no mirrored-playlist resolution**. It works for any organize-by-playlist
download, mirrored or not, and for the all-owned case (where nothing downloads).

Each stored path is run through ``resolve_library_file_path`` — the same resolver
playback uses — so a DB path that's host-formatted (Docker) maps to the real file
the container can see; a freshly-downloaded path already exists and passes
through unchanged.
