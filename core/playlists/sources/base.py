"""PlaylistSource Protocol + normalized data containers.

These dataclasses define the *single* shape every adapter must return.
The legacy backing clients each return slightly different dicts /
dataclasses; the adapter's job is to project those into ``PlaylistMeta``
and ``NormalizedTrack`` so callers don't have to know which source they
got the data from.

Two distinct shapes:

- ``PlaylistMeta``: cheap, lightweight — used for "list playlists for a
  tab" responses. No tracks.
- ``PlaylistDetail``: meta + full normalized track list. Used after the
  user selects a playlist to mirror.

Discovery flag:

- ``NormalizedTrack.needs_discovery`` is True for sources that return
  raw metadata only (ListenBrainz, Last.fm radio) — the caller must run
  the match step before the track is usable in the download pipeline.
  Sources that already carry a provider ID (Spotify, Tidal, etc.) set
  this to False.
