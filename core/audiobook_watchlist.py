"""Follow an author, and wishlist their new releases as they appear.

The audiobook equivalent of following an artist on the music side, and the same
shape as the podcast watchlist scan: check the things you follow on a schedule,
and queue whatever is new.

What "new" means is the whole design. Following an author must NOT dump their
back catalogue into the wishlist — Brandon Sanderson has 88 titles, and someone
who follows him wants the next one, not all of them. So a follow records the day
it was made, and only books published after that are picked up. Someone who
genuinely wants the backlog can set the cutoff back.

Everything after "this is new" is the existing pipeline: the book is wishlisted
at `exact` on its own narrator, and from there the ordinary wishlist pass
searches for it, ranks releases, checks the download is whole and files it. This
module adds a way in, not a second way through.
