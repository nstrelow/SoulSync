"""Orchestrate resolving a playlist's tracks to recording MBIDs for export (#903).

This is the testable heart of the export job: walk the playlist's tracks, resolve each to a
MusicBrainz recording MBID via an injected ``resolve_fn`` (which the job wires to the
cache -> DB -> file -> MusicBrainz waterfall), dedup repeated songs within the run so they
only cost one resolution, build the ordered "pseudo-playlist" of resolved tracks, and tally
live stats (resolved / unmatched / per-source / deduped) for the on-card status display.

Pure: all I/O (DB, file reads, MusicBrainz, cache) is behind ``resolve_fn`` and the optional
``on_progress`` callback, so the dedup + accounting logic is unit-testable without any
network or database. The returned ``resolved`` list feeds straight into ``jspf_export``.
