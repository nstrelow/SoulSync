"""Wire the real cheapest-first sources for the export MBID waterfall (#903).

``mbid_resolver`` is the pure waterfall; this module supplies the real I/O behind each
source and assembles the ``resolve_fn`` the export job uses:

1. **cache** — ``recording_mbid_cache`` (persistent (artist,title)->mbid).
2. **DB** — a text-matched library track's ``tracks.musicbrainz_recording_id``.
3. **file** — ``MUSICBRAINZ_RECORDING_ID`` tag of that track's file (when the DB row had
   no recording id but the file was tagged on import).
4. **ISRC** — discovery already pinned this row to a Deezer track id (``extra_data``);
   fetch that track's ISRC and resolve it to a recording MBID via MusicBrainz's exact
   ``/isrc/`` lookup. Script/language independent, so it catches dual-title and
   romanised-name tracks the live text search below misses.
5. **MusicBrainz** — live ``match_recording(track, artist)`` (rate-limited tail).

Every source is wrapped so any failure (missing table, unreadable file, MB timeout) returns
None — the waterfall just falls through, the export never breaks. ``build_resolve_fn`` also
writes a fresh non-cache hit back to the cache so the next export of the same song is free.

The DB and file rungs are gated: ``tracks.musicbrainz_recording_id`` is populated verbatim
from file tags at import (``core/imports/side_effects.py``), so a mis-tagged file poisons
both rungs identically. Before accepting either rung's MBID, ``build_resolve_fn`` rejects
it when the ``mbid_mismatch_detector`` repair job already has a pending finding against
that track/file — that job has already checked the MBID against MusicBrainz and found it
names a different recording. A rejected rung is a miss, so the waterfall falls through
instead of exporting the wrong recording. No network call is added to the cheap rungs.

    """Assemble the export ``resolve_fn(artist, title, track=None) -> (mbid, source_label)``.

    Runs cache -> DB -> file -> ISRC -> MusicBrainz, and writes a fresh (non-cache) hit
    back to the persistent cache. All sources are injectable so the wiring is
    unit-testable; defaults use the real cache module. The cache rung (rung 1,
    ``recording_mbid_cache``) is deliberately NOT gated below — see the note at the bottom
    of this docstring.

    ``track`` is the full mirrored-playlist row ``resolve_playlist_tracks`` passes, so the
    ISRC rung can read its ``extra_data`` (discovery's own matched id). It is optional so
    the 2-arg call (``resolve_fn(artist, title)``) still works; without a ``track`` the
    ISRC rung has nothing to key off and is skipped, same as any other miss.

    Before a DB or file MBID is accepted, one extra gate runs (a mis-tagged file poisons
    both the DB column and the file tag it was copied from at import, and the export
    waterfall used to trust either blindly): ``mbid_flagged_fn(track_id, file_path) ->
    bool`` — True when the repair job already flagged this track as wrong (a pending
    ``mbid_mismatch`` finding). Defaults to ``mbid_flagged_by_repair_finding`` (a DB read,
    no network). ``track_id``/``file_path`` come from ``track_lookup_fn(artist, title)``
    (default ``_default_track_lookup``), resolved once per (artist, title) and memoized —
    not re-queried per rung.

    A flagged MBID turns the rung into a miss, so the waterfall falls through (to file,
    then ISRC, then live MusicBrainz search) exactly as if that rung had returned nothing.
    The gate and the track lookup are memoized per ``resolve_fn`` (i.e. per export run).

    NOTE — the cache rung (``recording_mbid_cache``, populated by a fresh non-cache hit
    below) is NOT gated: it's a plain (artist,title)->mbid store with no track_id/file_path
    to flag-check. A row written by an EARLIER export, before this fix shipped, could still
    be poisoned — a one-off cache purge is a follow-up, not done here.
