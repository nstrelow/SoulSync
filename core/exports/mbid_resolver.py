"""Resolve a playlist track's MusicBrainz *recording* MBID, cheapest source first.

A ListenBrainz playlist export needs each track's recording MBID (``jspf_export``). A
SoulSync track can supply it from several places, in increasing cost:

1. **resolution cache** — a prior (artist,title)->mbid result (persistent; reused across
   playlists and runs, so the same song never costs twice).
2. **library DB** — ``tracks.musicbrainz_recording_id`` (set by the MusicBrainz
   enrichment worker).
3. **file tags** — ``MUSICBRAINZ_RECORDING_ID`` written into the audio file on import
   post-processing (catches tracks enriched at import but not via the worker).
4. **MusicBrainz lookup** — a live ``match_recording(artist, title)`` (rate-limited
   ~1 req/s; the slow tail — only hit when 1–3 miss).

This module is the **pure waterfall**: the caller passes ordered ``(label, fn)`` sources,
each ``fn(artist, title) -> mbid | None``, and ``resolve_recording_mbid`` returns the
first valid hit plus its label (for the live status / stats). The actual I/O (DB query,
mutagen read, MB request, cache read/write) lives in the export job that wires the real
sources — so this stays trivially unit-testable and short-circuits correctly.
