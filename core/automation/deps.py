"""Dependency-injection surface for automation handlers.

Each handler in ``core.automation.handlers`` is a top-level pure
function that accepts ``(config: dict, deps: AutomationDeps)`` instead
of reaching for module-level globals in ``web_server``. The deps
namespace bundles every callable, client, and mutable-state container
the handlers need.

Construction happens once at app startup in ``web_server.py``:

    from core.automation.deps import AutomationDeps, AutomationState
    state = AutomationState()
    deps = AutomationDeps(
        engine=automation_engine,
        state=state,
        get_database=get_database,
        spotify_client=spotify_client,
        ...
    )
    register_all(deps)

Tests construct a fake ``AutomationDeps`` with stub callables — every
handler is then exercisable without spinning up Flask, the DB, or
the real media-server clients.
