"""Automation handlers: ``video_process_movie_wishlist`` / ``video_process_episode_wishlist``.

The Soulseek counterpart of the YouTube wishlist drain — the piece that finally makes the
people/airing scans pay off. For wished, RELEASED movies (and aired episodes) it searches
Soulseek, picks the best release per the quality profile, and enqueues the download; the
existing ``download_monitor`` finishes + organises + archives it, exactly like a manual grab.

Shape mirrors the YouTube drain (Boulder: "same standard"): it processes the WHOLE eligible
wishlist (no total cap), but the slow part — each item needs a ~20s blocking Soulseek search
— runs only a FEW at a time (``max_concurrent``). A ``guard`` keeps the next hourly tick from
overlapping a run that's still working, so it can't pile up.

Movies are gated on ``status='wanted'`` (released; skips 'monitored'/unreleased). Episodes
are all-wished (the airing scan only adds aired ones). Items already downloading are skipped
so re-runs never double-grab. The pick is the top ACCEPTED release — the ranker already
encodes the quality profile's accept/reject/score, so no extra rules here.

Shared automation side (may import ``core.video`` / ``api.video``); owns its own progress.
The search + enqueue are injected seams, so selection/pick/record are pure + unit-tested.
