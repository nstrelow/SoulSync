"""Automation handler: ``video_refresh_airing_schedules`` action.

Keeps the TV calendar honest. The "Wishlist Episodes Airing Today" automation reads the
LOCAL ``episodes`` table — which is only refreshed from TMDB on initial enrichment, a manual
re-match, or lazily when you open a show's page. So a newly-announced or rescheduled episode
can sit unknown indefinitely, and the airing automation misses it.

This runs daily (a couple hours before the airing run) and re-pulls each still-airing
watchlist show's season/episode schedule from TMDB (air dates, stills, overviews) so the
calendar is current when the airing automation reads it.

Scope: the EFFECTIVE watchlist's continuing LIBRARY shows (follows ∪ airing library shows,
skipping ended/canceled — they'll never air again, and skipping tmdb-only follows, which have
no episodes table to refresh). Like the other video handlers it owns its progress reporting
(``_manages_own_progress``); the show fetch + per-show refresh are injected seams, so the
handler is a pure function tests drive with fakes.
