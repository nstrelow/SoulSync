"""Update yt-dlp from inside SoulSync, and be honest about what that does.

YouTube changes how it serves video faster than any release schedule, so a yt-dlp
that is a few weeks old starts answering ``HTTP Error 403: Forbidden`` on videos
that worked yesterday. The live install proved the cost: 22 videos hit that error
across many channels, and one had already burned all three retry attempts and been
skipped permanently — for a cause a package update fixes.

Three things this module refuses to paper over:

**The update does not take effect until a restart.** ``yt_dlp`` is already imported;
replacing the files on disk does not replace the loaded module, and reloading a
package that size is not reliable. A button that quietly implies otherwise is worse
than no button — the user updates, retries, gets the same 403, and stops trusting
it. :func:`interpret_result` therefore always carries ``restart_required``.

**Nightly is the default, deliberately.** Stable lags precisely on the extractor
fixes this exists to deliver. Stable remains selectable for anyone who wants it.

**Failure is reported as what it was.** A read-only site-packages, a distro-managed
Python, a container, or the wrong user all fail differently and need different
fixes; collapsing them into "update failed" sends people hunting the wrong thing.

The core here is pure — the subprocess and the network are injected — because the
one thing worse than not updating is a settings button that hangs the server.
