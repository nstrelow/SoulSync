"""Soulseek as an audiobook source.

Prowlarr answers with a release: one torrent or NZB that a client fetches on
its own. Soulseek answers with a FOLDER on one person's machine, and fetching
it means asking for every file in it and following each transfer separately.
The two are different enough that pretending otherwise inside the Prowlarr
module would have made both harder to read, so the shape is translated here
and everything downstream keeps working in releases.

The translation:
  * An slskd AlbumResult becomes an AudiobookRelease with protocol
    ``soulseek``, so the existing ranking scores it against the wanted
    narrator, language and abridgement exactly like a torrent.
  * ``soulseek`` on the release carries what it takes to fetch it back: the
    peer's name, the folder, and every file with its size.
  * A grab starts one transfer per file and hands back all their ids. The
    download row stores them as a JSON list in ``client_id``, and the monitor
    aggregates them into one progress number.

Nothing here reaches into music's soulseek flow. It borrows the client (which
is where the connection, the throttle and the retry live) and does its own
bookkeeping, so a book can never land in a music batch or take a slot the
music pool was counting on.
