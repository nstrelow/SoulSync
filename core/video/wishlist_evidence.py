"""Why a wishlist row is stuck — kept, instead of thrown away every hour.

A wanted item searches on the hourly drain, gets candidates, judges each against
the quality profile, and takes the best acceptable one. When nothing is
acceptable it increments ``search_attempts`` and discards everything else. So a
row that has searched forty times looks exactly like one waiting for next week's
episode, and the user cannot tell "be patient" from "this will never work".

Three rows on the live install sit at thirteen fruitless searches (Aussie Shore
S02E03/E09/E10) with nothing on screen to explain any of them.

Everything needed is already in hand at the moment of refusal: each candidate
carries its ``quality_label`` and a ``rejected`` string saying which rule turned
it down. This module turns that into one line worth storing.

**The distinction that makes it useful.** Refusals split into two families, and
only one is about availability:

* *identity* — "Wrong season", "Wrong year", "This is a TV release, not the
  movie". The release is not this item. Reporting it as "best available" would
  be a lie; these are search noise.
* *availability* — "1080p WEB isn't in your enabled tiers", "No seeders",
  "Over your 20 GB size cap", "Uploader blocklisted". The release IS this item
  and a rule of yours refused it. That is the actionable half, and it is what
  turns "why is this stuck" into a decision.

Pure: no DB, no network, no clock.
