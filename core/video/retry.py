"""Auto-retry logic for video downloads (the music-style depth).

When a grabbed release fails (transfer error / peer cancel / never lands), the engine
shouldn't just give up — it should try the NEXT-best candidate from the same search,
and when those run out, RE-SEARCH with a different query (e.g. a movie without its
year) and try those. This module is the pure decision engine; the monitor performs
the I/O (start the download / run the requery).

Pure (json + stdlib only); unit-tested. Isolated — no music imports.

    ``Insomnia.2024`` and ``The.Voice.AU``, so a query built from the raw title
    cannot match, and every variant in the ladder below inherited the same dead
    parenthetical. On the live install six such shows had burnt 5,071 fruitless
    searches between them without a single grab.

    Order matters more than length: the retry budget is a handful of attempts, so
    the primary title comes first (never regress a search that already works),
    then the scene form with the brackets flattened, then without them at all,
    then TMDB's aliases. For an ordinary title every variant collapses onto the
