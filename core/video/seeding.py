"""Torrent seeding lifecycle (arr-parity P5).

The importer COPIES a finished torrent's file into the library, so the client
keeps seeding — and until now nothing ever let go: every grab seeded forever
(or until the user cleaned the client by hand). Radarr manages the tail: seed
until the ratio/time goals are met, then remove the torrent from the client.

This sweep does exactly that for completed video torrent grabs:

  · goals live in the video download config (``seed_ratio_goal`` /
    ``seed_time_goal_hours``) — BOTH default 0, which means the sweep is OFF
    and behavior is unchanged; managing someone's torrent client is opt-in
  · ratio/seeding-time come from the client (qBittorrent reports both); when
    a client doesn't, the time goal falls back to the download row's
    ``completed_at`` age — a conservative floor (import time < seed time)
  · goals met → remove the torrent from the client (``seed_remove_data``,
    default on, also deletes the CLIENT'S copy — the library copy is separate
    and never touched) and mark the row ``seed_released``
  · a torrent the client no longer knows is marked released (nothing to manage)

Usenet never seeds; slskd has no concept of it — torrent rows only.
