"""The Fresh Releases board: refreshed on a schedule, served from cache.

Fresh Releases used to be built on the render path — open the tab, wait for the
EXT.to homepage to come back through a Cloudflare challenge, then look at it.
That was already slow, and enriching each row from its own detail page (which is
where the poster, IMDb id, rating and fact list live) would have made it far
worse: every row is a separate challenge, and a bad minute on ext.to's side can
take 40 seconds per page.

So the work moved off the render path entirely. ``refresh_board`` does the whole
job — pull the homepage, enrich every row, write the result down — and the tab
just reads the last snapshot, which makes opening it instant. It runs from two
places that do the identical thing:

  * the ``video_extto_fresh_refresh`` automation, on whatever schedule the user
    sets (hourly suits the board's own turnover), and
  * the Refresh button on the tab, when the user wants it now.

CACHING IS WHAT MAKES THE HOURLY CADENCE CHEAP. The board turns over slowly:
most of what appears in one hour's pull was there the hour before, and a
release's detail page never meaningfully changes. Details are therefore keyed by
detail URL and kept in video.db, so a returning release costs nothing and each
run only pays for what is genuinely new. A first run on a cold cache is the
expensive one; every run after it is mostly free.

# is having a bad minute. A count cap does not bound that at all - 40 pages at 40s
# is still 27 minutes, which would overlap the next hourly tick. So the deadline is
# the actual guard and the count is a backstop, set high enough that a healthy run
# finishes the whole board in one go instead of dribbling it over two.
#
# Neither limit normally engages: they bite on a cold cache. In steady state only
# the genuinely new releases are fetched, and whatever a run defers is logged and
# picked up by the next one, so coverage catches up rather than being lost.
