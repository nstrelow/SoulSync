"""RSS-speed grabbing — Sonarr's RSS sync, via Prowlarr (video side).

The wishlist drain acquires by SEARCHING each item hourly. This module closes
the reaction-time gap from the other direction: every few minutes it pulls the
indexers' LATEST releases (the Newznab empty-query "RSS" form — one aggregate
Prowlarr call, no per-item searches) and matches them against the wishlist.
A wanted episode posted to an indexer lands minutes later instead of at the
next drain tick — the single biggest speed difference vs Sonarr/Radarr.

Everything acquisition-shaped is the drain's own seams, so behavior can't
drift: the same GATED wishlist queries (released/aired only — RSS must not
hunt unreleased titles), the same upgrade-until-cutoff annotation (owned items
accept strictly-better only), the same ranker (``_evaluate_hits`` — quality
profile + blocklist + scope validation), the same ``pick_best`` and the same
``_default_enqueue`` (disk guard included). Active-key dedupe prevents double
grabs against in-flight downloads and the drain alike.

Soulseek is untouched — there is no feed to poll on a P2P network; slskd
acquisition stays the drain's job.
