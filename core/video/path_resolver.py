"""Video path resolver — from the SERVER's view of a file path to a real one.

The scanner stores what the media server reports (Plex ``part.file`` /
Jellyfin ``Path``) — the path as seen from INSIDE the server's own container/
host. From SoulSync's filesystem view that path often doesn't exist (different
Docker mounts, drive letters, NAS exports). This is the video twin of the
music side's ``core.library.path_resolver`` (the issue-#476 class of bugs):
try the stored path as-is, then re-root its tail segments against the folders
SoulSync actually knows about until a file exists.

Upgrades depend on this: replacing an owned copy means finding the REAL file,
not the template location SoulSync would have chosen for a fresh import.
