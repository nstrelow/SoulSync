"""Source-artist → library lookup helpers.

Extracted from `web_server.py` so the logic can be imported and unit-tested
without booting the Flask app, Spotify client, Soulseek connection, etc.

Two concepts live here:

  * ``SOURCE_ID_FIELD`` — the per-source column on the ``artists`` table that
    stores the external service ID (Spotify track ID, Deezer artist ID, …).
    This map is what ties a result clicked in the source-aware Search results
    back to a library record so we can serve the richer library view.

  * ``find_library_artist_for_source`` — given a source-aware click (e.g.
    ``deezer:525046``), try to locate a matching library artist. First by
    direct column match against the source's ID column, then by case-
    insensitive name match scoped to the active media server.

    Lookup order:

         library record with the right external ID is a hit). If that id is
         stamped on MORE than one library artist, the mapping is corrupt /
         ambiguous (e.g. an enrichment bug wrote one Deezer id onto several
         artists) — we refuse to guess and fall through, so the caller can
         show the source artist directly instead of an arbitrary wrong one.
      2. Case-insensitive name match within ``active_server`` (defaults to the
         active media server when not provided), so we don't jump the user
         across server contexts on a name collision.
