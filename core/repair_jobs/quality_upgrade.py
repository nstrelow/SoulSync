"""Quality Upgrade Finder maintenance job.

Replaces the old auto-acting "Quality Scanner" tool. That tool decided quality
purely by file EXTENSION (so a 128 kbps MP3 and a 320 kbps MP3 looked identical),
ignored the bitrate-based quality profile, and silently dumped every match
straight into the wishlist with no review — which, on the default profile, meant
flagging an entire non-lossless library at once.

This job does it the way the rest of the app works: it SCANS (watchlist artists
or the whole library), judges each track against the user's quality profile using
BOTH format and bitrate, and for anything below the preferred quality it searches
the configured metadata source for a better version and emits a FINDING. Nothing
is queued until you review and Apply the finding — at which point the matched
track (carrying its album context) is added to the wishlist, exactly like every
other acquisition path.

Quality is judged using the real file (mutagen-measured bit depth / sample rate /
bitrate) checked against the user's v3 ranked profile targets — fully profile-driven,
no hardcoded thresholds. Transcode/"fake lossless" detection is the separate Fake
Lossless Detector job.
