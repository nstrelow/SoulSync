"""Quality Upgrade Scanner Job — flags library tracks below the user's profile.

Walks the music folders ON DISK (transfer + download + every configured library
path) exactly like the Orphan / Fake-Lossless detectors — those reliably "see"
files because they os.walk real directories instead of trying to resolve the
DB's stored (often relative) paths. For each audio file it probes the ACTUAL
measured audio quality (bit depth / sample rate / bitrate via the same
`probe_audio_quality` the download import guard uses) and checks it against the
user's v3 ranked targets with `quality_meets_profile` (strict — fallback
ignored, that's a download-time concession, not a definition of "good enough").

Every file that satisfies none of the targets becomes a finding the user can:
  - 'redownload': add the track to the wishlist and delete the low-quality file
  - 'delete': remove the low-quality file (+ DB row when known)
  - 'ignore': dismiss the finding (handled in the UI via the dismiss endpoint)

Each walked file is matched back to its DB track (by path suffix) so the finding
carries the real title/artist/album + track id; when no DB row matches, the
file's own tags are used and the finding is filed as a loose 'file'.
