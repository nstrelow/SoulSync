"""Background pass that keeps looking for wishlisted audiobooks.

A book someone wants is often not on any indexer the day they ask for it. The
wishlist exists so that "not yet" turns into "got it" without anyone having to
remember to search again.

Scheduling
----------
NOT here. The pass is driven by the shared automation engine as the
``audiobook_process_wishlist`` system automation, exactly as music drains its
wishlist through ``process_wishlist`` and video through
``video_process_movie_wishlist``.

This module first shipped with its own daemon thread and timer, which was a
mistake worth naming: an automation appears on the Automations page, can be
paused, rescheduled or run by hand, and obeys the master switch. A private
thread is none of those, and a user who wanted it to stop had nowhere to say so.

Pacing
------
Two separate limits, and both matter.

The automation decides how often a pass runs and takes only a handful of items
each time. Each item then has its own backoff, so one unfindable book cannot be
searched every pass forever while newer entries wait behind it.

Underneath both, every search still goes through the shared Prowlarr throttle —
the same budget the music and video sides spend. That is the limit that actually
protects the indexers, and this worker is deliberately quieter than it needs to
be so a long audiobook wishlist can never out-shout a music wishlist drain.
(Boulder, Aug 2026, on the music side doing exactly that: "it will search one
item on torrent, less than 5 seconds later is doing a different search".)

Isolation
---------
Nothing here reaches the music download batches, the music worker pool or the
music wishlist. Wanted books live in the audiobook database, releases are found
through the audiobook release search, and grabs go to the shared download client
under the audiobook category.
