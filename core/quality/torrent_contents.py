"""Read the file list out of a .torrent, without a new dependency.

#1149 asks for "prefer a release with verified FLAC files over a title-based
guess". We already fetch the .torrent server-side before handing it to the
client (#1139), so the real file list is in memory at exactly the moment we
still have the option not to enqueue it. It was simply never read.

Bencode is a four-token format and only the ``info`` dictionary is needed, so
this is a small decoder rather than a dependency. A self-hosted app pays for
every requirement in install friction, and pulling one in to read a list of
filenames is a poor trade.

CONTRACT: this NEVER raises. A torrent it cannot parse returns None, which
callers must read as "no evidence" and fall back to the title, not as
"rejected" — a decoder bug must not become an outage where nothing downloads.
