"""Quality-aware candidate selection shared by the search engine and the
download orchestrator.

``rank_with_targets`` is the pure core: it ranks candidates against a target
list and reports whether any candidate met a *real* target (strict, fallback
off). The engine uses that ``satisfied`` flag to decide whether the current
source is good enough or it should fall through to the next source in the
hybrid chain.

``rank_for_profile`` is the thin DB-backed wrapper that loads the user's
quality profile (with v2->v3 migration) and delegates.
