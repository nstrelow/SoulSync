"""BackgroundDownloadWorker — engine-owned thread spawning + state
lifecycle for downloads.

Today every streaming download client (YouTube, Tidal, Qobuz, HiFi,
Deezer, SoundCloud) hand-rolls the same thread-spawn pattern:

```python
async def download(self, ...):
    download_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    with self._download_lock:
        self.active_downloads[download_id] = {...initial state...}
    threading.Thread(
        target=self._download_thread_worker,
        args=(download_id, target_id, display_name, ...),
        daemon=True,
    ).start()
    return download_id

def _download_thread_worker(self, download_id, target_id, display_name, ...):
    with self._download_semaphore:
        # rate-limit sleep
        # update state to 'InProgress, Downloading'
        file_path = self._download_sync(...)  # the source-specific atomic op
        # update state to 'Completed, Succeeded' / 'Errored'
```

That pattern is duplicated 6+ times across the codebase (~70 LOC
each, ~490 total). The worker class lifts it into the engine — each
plugin only has to provide the atomic op (``impl_callable``) and
declare its rate-limit policy. Adding a new download source becomes
a much smaller patch.

Phase C1 scope: introduce the worker. No client migrated yet — the
worker just exists for C2–C7 to migrate sources one at a time, each
under a passing pinning test.

class BackgroundDownloadWorker:
    """Engine-owned thread spawner for per-source downloads.

    State-machine semantics (preserved verbatim from the legacy
    per-client workers so consumers reading these fields keep
    working):

    - ``Initializing`` — set on dispatch, before the thread starts.
    - ``InProgress, Downloading`` — set when the worker thread
      acquires the semaphore and is about to call the impl.
    - ``Completed, Succeeded`` — set when impl returns a non-None
      file path. ``progress=100.0`` and ``file_path=<the path>``
      also written.
    - ``Errored`` — set when impl returns None OR raises. The
      record is left in place so downstream consumers can inspect
      what failed.

    Per-source serialization: each source gets a ``threading.Semaphore``
    (default size 1, configurable per-source via ``set_concurrency``).
    Same shape the existing clients use today (each source defines
    its own semaphore). Engine owning them centrally lets a future
    Phase E rate-limiter swap the semaphore for a smarter pool.

    Per-source delay-between-downloads: default 0 seconds (most
    sources don't need it). YouTube currently uses 3s, Qobuz uses
    1s — the legacy values get configured in via ``set_delay``
    when the source registers.
