"""Shared dataclasses for the media-server contract.

Plex / Jellyfin / Navidrome clients all surfaced near-identical
``XTrackInfo`` and ``XPlaylistInfo`` shapes (id, title, artist,
album, duration, track_number, year, optional rating) because every
consumer needed the same shape downstream. The per-server class
names were a copy-paste artifact, not a real contract difference.

This module owns the canonical types. Plex's existing classmethod
constructors (``TrackInfo.from_plex_track``,
``PlaylistInfo.from_plex_playlist``) live here. Jellyfin and
Navidrome currently construct ``TrackInfo`` inline at their call
sites — lifting those into matching ``from_jellyfin_dict`` /
``from_navidrome_dict`` classmethods is a clean followup but isn't
needed for the dataclass unification this module ships.

Heavy server SDK types (``PlexTrack``) imported under TYPE_CHECKING
so this module stays import-light.
