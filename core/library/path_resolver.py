"""Resolve database-stored file paths to actual files on disk.

Database track rows store file paths as the media server reported them
(`/music/Artist/Album/track.flac`, `H:\\Music\\Artist\\...`, etc). When
SoulSync runs in Docker, those paths don't exist as-is inside the
container — the user's library is bind-mounted at a container path
(commonly `/music`) that has nothing to do with what Plex/Jellyfin
recorded. Same problem for native installs that point at a NAS via SMB:
the path the media server scanned isn't the path SoulSync reads.

The resolver tries the raw path first (cheap happy-path), then walks
progressively shorter suffixes against every configured base directory:
the transfer folder, the slskd download folder, every configured Plex
library location, and every entry in the user's `library.music_paths`
config. The first existing match wins.

This module replaces four duplicated copies of the same function (each
with the same incomplete logic) that lived in
`core/repair_worker.py` and three modules under `core/repair_jobs/`.
The duplicates only checked the transfer + download folders and
silently returned None for files in the actual media-server library —
which is why, for example, the Album Completeness "Auto-Fill" button
returned ``Could not determine album folder from existing tracks`` for
every Docker user (issue #476).

The web server has its own near-duplicate at
``web_server.py:_resolve_library_file_path`` which already covers the
full search space; this module is the lifted, shared version usable
from any background worker.
