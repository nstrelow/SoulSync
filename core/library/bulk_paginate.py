"""Paginate a bulk media-server fetch while feeding the no-progress watchdog.

The library scan fetches every track/album by paging a server API. The DB-update
watchdog (``core/database_update_health.py``) kills a job that reports no progress
for 300s. The old Jellyfin fetch used a single 10 000-item page, so a whole
library came back in ONE request that emitted NO progress while it was in flight —
on a slow server that single request exceeded 300s and the watchdog declared the
job "stuck" even though it was alive, not hung (Discord: DXP4800 NAS, 7148 tracks,
"Fetching all tracks in bulk…").

``paginate_all_items`` pages at a size chosen so progress is emitted on a cadence
set by the PAGE SIZE, not the library size — the watchdog is fed every page, so it
can never starve mid-fetch regardless of how big the library is. It is pure: all
I/O lives in the injected ``fetch_page``, so the pagination + progress + failure-
shrink logic is unit-testable without a server.

This does NOT change WHAT is fetched (same query, same fields, same items) — only
how it's paged and that every page reports progress (the old loop skipped progress
on the final/only page, which is the entire bug for a sub-page-size library).

    ``fetch_page`` returns the page's items (a list, possibly empty = end), or

    is halved down to ``min_page_size`` and retried, then abandoned after two
    consecutive failures at the floor.

    Progress is reported after EVERY non-empty page (including the final/only one),

    drained and ``complete=False`` when the fetch was abandoned at the floor:
