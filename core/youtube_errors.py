"""Tell YouTube's failures apart, because they are not the same failure.

The drain gives a video three attempts and then stops re-queueing it forever. That
budget is right for a download that *might* work next time and wrong for the two
cases either side of it, and Boulder's live database has one of each:

* A video that had not been released yet — *"Premieres in 3 days"* — burned all
  three attempts inside two hours on the day it was queued and is now permanently
  skipped. It premiered days ago. Nothing will ever fetch it. Counting "not out
  yet" as "broken" is the bug.
* Four members-only videos each took three attempts over several hours to learn
  something the very first attempt already knew. Paywalled is paywalled.

And the case in the middle, which is the one that actually matters right now:
five ``HTTP Error 403: Forbidden`` failures in two days, all different channels.
That is the signature of YouTube's bot-detection moving on while yt-dlp stays
still. It is genuinely retryable — but only after yt-dlp is updated, so the
message has to SAY that instead of leaving five identical mysteries.

Classification reads the stored error text, which means it applies to history
already on disk: the premiere above un-sticks itself the next time the drain runs,
with no migration.

Pure: no DB, no network, no yt-dlp import.
