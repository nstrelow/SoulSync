"""Torrent client adapter contract.

``TorrentClientAdapter`` is a structural Protocol — any class with
these method signatures is treated as a valid adapter. The download
plugin layer (built in a later commit) dispatches generically against
this surface so it doesn't have to know whether the user picked
qBittorrent, Transmission, or Deluge.

The contract intentionally hides protocol-specific details:
- qBittorrent uses cookie auth + multipart form uploads.
- Transmission uses an X-Transmission-Session-Id header + JSON RPC.
- Deluge 2.x uses /json with a session cookie.

All three converge on the same eight verbs below.
