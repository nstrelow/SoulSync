"""Auto-Import Worker — watches staging folder, identifies music, and processes automatically.

Scans the staging folder for audio files and album folders, identifies them
using tags/filenames/AcoustID, matches to metadata source tracklists, and
processes high-confidence matches through the post-processing pipeline.
Lower-confidence matches are queued for user review.

Supports both album folders (directories containing audio files) and single
loose audio files in the staging root.
