"""Guard against char-level title false positives in track matching.

Issue #769: playlist sync matched tracks that aren't in the library to a
DIFFERENT song by the SAME artist, with high confidence — e.g. "Dani
California" -> "Californication" (Red Hot Chili Peppers), "Under The Bridge"
-> "Around the World". The confidence formula is ``0.5*title + 0.5*artist``,
and a same-artist comparison always yields ``artist = 1.0``, so the title score
is the only thing that can tell two of an artist's songs apart. But the title
score is a ``difflib.SequenceMatcher`` character ratio, which over-credits
unrelated titles that happen to share a long substring ("californi…") or only a
stopword ("the"): 0.67 and 0.62 respectively. With the flat 0.5 artist term
that lands at 0.83 / 0.81 — well over the 0.7 sync threshold.

``titles_plausibly_same`` adds a cheap word-level sanity check on top of the
char ratio: accept a pair only when it's near-identical char-wise (so typos and
punctuation/casing variants — "Beleive"/"Believe", "HUMBLE."/"Humble" — still
match) OR the two titles share at least one significant (non-stopword) token.
Two genuinely different songs by the same artist share no content word, so they
get rejected; the real track is then correctly reported missing.

    """Whether a DASH-separated tail describes a version rather than a title.

    Brackets are unambiguous — anything inside ``(...)`` is an annotation, so
    a single marker token anywhere in the group is enough there. A dash is
    not: it separates artist from title, and plenty of real titles open with
    a marker word. "Contains a marker" therefore over-strips catastrophically
    (PR #1121 review — ``Queen - Radio Ga Ga`` → ``queen``, ``Billy Joel -
    Piano Man`` → ``billy joel``), and those decisions feed AcoustID
    verification, so it mis-verifies genuine tracks.

    What separates the families is WHERE the marker sits, but "ends in a
    marker" alone is too narrow to be the whole rule: Spotify's two most
    common tails, ``- Remastered 2011`` and ``- Live at Wembley Stadium``,
    both end in a non-marker word, so that rule left the dash form
    normalizing differently from the ``(Remastered 2011)`` bracket form — the
    exact drift this helper exists to prevent. Three shapes are accepted:

      A. the tail ENDS in a marker — ``Don Diablo Edit``, ``2011 Remaster``,
         ``Slowed + Reverb``, ``Live``. This is what admits the
         producer-credit forms; requiring the tail to be *entirely* marker
         words would drop them.
      B. markers plus padding ONLY — ``Remastered 2011``, ``Remaster 2009``,
         ``Sped Up``, ``Bonus Track``. Padding is a deliberately small closed
         set (:data:`_VERSION_TAIL_FILLERS`) plus 19xx/20xx years; arbitrary
         numbers are excluded so ``Take 3`` and ``Vol. 2`` stay put.
      C. a performance marker introducing a venue — ``Live at Wembley``,
         ``Live From Paris``, ``Recorded at Abbey Road``.

    and one veto that outranks all three: a tail containing a
    :data:`_DISTINCT_TRACK_TOKENS` word (``Pt. 2``, ``Interlude``) names a
    different track, so it is never dropped.

    Rule C's only known over-match is a real title of the shape ``Live in the
    Moment``. That is survivable by construction, not by luck:
    ``audio_verification.similarity`` scores the un-stripped form as well and
    keeps the better of the two, so a wrong strip costs nothing while a missed
    strip would leave a genuine ``- Remastered 2011`` track below threshold.

    ``_VERSION_MARKER_TOKENS`` stays shared with
    :func:`strip_subtitle_qualifiers` so both paths grow the same vocabulary.
