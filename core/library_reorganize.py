"""Re-route a library album's existing files through the same
post-processing pipeline that handles fresh downloads.

The old reorganize endpoint reinvented several wheels — its own template
engine, its own disc-number resolution from file tags, its own sidecar
sweep, its own collision detection. Each of those drifted from the
canonical post-processing path over time, producing reorganize-only
bugs (multi-disc deluxe collapsing to single-disc when even one file's
tag was missing; tracks silently skipped when their file paths didn't
resolve on disk; etc.).

The new design follows the import page's pattern: copy each file to a
staging folder, build the same context dict the download workers
build, then call ``_post_process_matched_download`` for each one.
Post-processing already knows how to pick the right destination, write
the right tags, handle multi-disc subfolders, recreate sidecars (cover
art, lyrics), and run AcoustID verification — there's nothing for
reorganize to add on top.

Hard requirement: the album must have at least one stored
metadata-source ID (spotify_album_id / itunes_album_id / deezer_id /
discogs_id / soul_id). With no source ID we have nothing authoritative
to ask for the canonical tracklist, and silently degrading to file
tags is exactly the failure mode the old code path produced. Albums
without a source ID are reported back to the caller and skipped
entirely.

    ``metadata_source``:
        - ``'api'`` (default): query the configured metadata source(s)
          for the canonical tracklist (existing behavior). Issues an
          API call.
        - ``'tags'``: read each file's embedded tags as the source of
          truth (issue #592). Zero API calls; trusts the user's
          enriched library.

    When ``metadata_source='tags'``, ``resolve_file_path_fn`` MUST be
    provided (the planner needs to read the actual files). The
    ``primary_source`` and ``strict_source`` params are ignored in

    - `disc_number` for each track comes from its matched API entry; if
      unmatched, `api_track is None` and the caller decides what to do.

    are injected so the orchestrator stays in ``core/`` and is unit
    testable without spinning up the Flask app.

    Args:
        album_id: Library album ID.
        db: Database object exposing ``_get_connection()``.
        staging_root: Root staging directory under the user's download
            path. A per-album subfolder is created beneath it; the
            whole subfolder is removed at the end of the run.
        resolve_file_path_fn: Resolves a DB-stored file path to the
            actual on-disk path (or ``None`` if missing). Injected
            because the resolution logic lives in ``web_server``.
        post_process_fn: ``_post_process_matched_download``. Must set
            ``context['_final_processed_path']`` on success.
        update_track_path_fn: Called as
            ``update_track_path_fn(track_id, new_path)`` after each
            successful post-process to update the DB row. ``None`` to
            skip (e.g. in tests).
        cleanup_empty_dir_fn: Called with each source directory we
            emptied so the caller can prune empty parents. ``None`` to
            skip.
        on_progress: Optional callback for live status updates.
            Receives a dict with any subset of the standard reorganize
            state keys (``current_track``, ``processed``, ``moved``,
            ``skipped``, ``failed``, ``errors``).
        primary_source: Override for the configured primary source.
            Defaults to ``get_primary_source()``.
        stop_check: Returns True when the caller wants the reorganize
            to abort early (e.g. server shutdown).

    Returns:
        Status summary dict with ``status`` ∈ ``{'completed',
        'no_album', 'no_tracks', 'no_source_id'}`` plus per-track
        counters.
