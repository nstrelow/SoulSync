"""Shared helpers for the album-bundle download flow.

The torrent and usenet download plugins both implement a
``download_album_to_staging`` method that searches Prowlarr for a
whole release, hands it to the active downloader, walks the
resulting audio files, and copies them into the staging folder. The
two implementations share the same release-picker heuristic and the
same staging-path collision logic.

Pulled out of ``core/download_plugins/torrent.py`` so the usenet
plugin doesn't have to import private helpers from a sibling
plugin (Cin's "no leaky module boundaries" standard).

Also exposes ``atomic_copy_to_staging`` — the audio file is copied
to a ``.tmp.<random>`` sidecar first and atomically renamed onto its
final extension. The Auto-Import worker filters by audio extension
so the in-flight ``.tmp`` file is never picked up mid-copy, closing
the race between the album-bundle copy loop and Auto-Import's
folder scan.

    Heuristic, in priority order:
    0. Album-TITLE relevance gate (#730): drop candidates whose title doesn't
       sufficiently match the requested album. Prowlarr returns broad fuzzy
       matches, so without this the most-popular result wins even when it's a
       different album. When ``album_name`` is given and NOTHING clears the
       relevance floor, return None — the caller then falls back to per-track
       rather than downloading a confident mismatch.
    0a. FORMAT gate (#1149): drop candidates whose format cannot satisfy the
       caller's quality profile. ``allowed_formats=None`` disables it, which
       is what a profile with fallback enabled (or no ranked targets) means
       everywhere else in the pipeline. Quality used to be the SECOND sort key
       after seeders, so a well-seeded MP3 rip beat a FLAC rip with fewer
       seeders no matter what the profile said — sorting cannot express "never
       this", only "prefer that". A release whose format cannot be determined
       is dropped too rather than assumed lossy and ranked.
    0b. SIZE gate: drop candidates whose bytes contradict the quality their
       title claims — a 60 MB "FLAC" of a 45-minute album is a transcode, and
       a release averaging far more than its stated lossy bitrate is not the
       album that was searched for. Same mechanism as Lidarr's
       AcceptableSizeSpecification (expected kbit/s x known duration), and the
       same fail-open contract: without ``expected_duration_seconds`` there is
       no opinion. Runs before availability so the log names the quality lie
       rather than a dead swarm.
    0c. Availability gate (#1139): drop candidates whose indexer-reported
       seeder count is BELOW ``min_seeders``. Sorting by seeders was never
       enough — with every candidate on zero, the sort still handed back a
       release nobody is serving, and the download then sat on "downloading
       metadata" until the deadline. Candidates that report NO seeder count
       at all (``seeders is None``: usenet, and torrent indexers that omit
       the field) are exempt — this only drops releases we positively know
       are dead. ``min_seeders=0`` disables it.
    1. Reasonable album-ish size (40 MB – 3 GB) — drops single-track
       releases that snuck in and quarantines suspicious giants.
    2. When ranked targets are supplied, the best target any available
       release satisfies wins. Exact bitrate / sample-rate / bit-depth
       constraints are honored; with fallback disabled an unproven release is
       refused before it reaches the client.
    3. Within that quality bucket, higher measured quality wins, followed by
       seeders (or Usenet grabs) and size. Without ranked targets the legacy
       seeders-first heuristic is retained.

    Lifted out of ``UsenetDownloadPlugin._poll_album_download`` and the
    sibling torrent method so the loop is testable in isolation and so
    both plugins share the same exit semantics.

    Contract:
    - ``get_status()`` returns the adapter status object for the bound
      job, ``None`` when the client doesn't know about the job
      currently (transient or terminal — disambiguated by retry count).
    - ``emit(state, **fields)`` is the plugin's progress callback —
      this function calls it on EVERY successful poll with
      ``state='downloading'`` and ALWAYS calls it once more with
      ``state='failed'`` before returning ``None`` on any failure path,
      so the UI doesn't freeze on the last 'downloading' emit.
    - ``complete_states`` is the adapter's terminal-success set
      ('completed' alone for usenet; 'seeding' + 'completed' for
      torrent because seeding-but-files-on-disk also counts).
    - ``failed_states`` is the explicit-failure set. The adapter-level
      'error' (unmapped state default) is intentionally NOT in here —
      that's treated as a transient miss because a real SAB / NZBGet
      / qBit never returns a literal 'error' state on a healthy job;
      it's only our default fallback for unknown queue strings. Real
      example: SAB's 'Pp' post-processing state was unmapped → became
      'error' → poll infinite-looped until the 6-hour timeout.
    - ``transient_miss_threshold`` is the number of consecutive None /
      'error' reads tolerated before declaring the job gone. Sized for
      the SAB queue→history gap window (~10s) — a vanished job should
      fail fast.
    - ``completed_no_path_threshold`` is a SEPARATE, longer window for
      the "client says complete but no save_path yet" case. The download
      already succeeded, so this defaults to ~120s (configurable via
      ``download_source.album_bundle_completed_no_path_seconds``) instead
      of reusing the 10s miss window — #721 showed SAB can take 2+ minutes
      to write ``storage``. Once the window is exhausted, the loop does
      NOT immediately trust the adapter's ``incomplete_path`` (the on-disk
      in-progress dir) — that path can still be actively written by the
      client's own unpack/repair/move post-processing at the exact moment
      we'd read it (P2-21). It is only accepted once ``snapshot_path``
      reports the SAME fingerprint (size/file-count/mtime) on two polls in
      a row, i.e. the directory has visibly stopped changing; until then
      the loop keeps polling (bounded by the outer ``timeout``, not by
      this window). Terminal ``failed`` only fires when there's no path of
      any kind to scan.

    - ``stall_check(status, now)`` is an optional per-poll "is this job
      making no forward progress" question, and ``on_stall()`` an optional
      cleanup hook that returns the failure reason. Injected rather than
      imported because what counts as a stall is protocol-specific: a
      torrent can sit forever on "downloading metadata" with a byte counter
      that ticks up from protocol noise, which is what
      ``torrent_stall.StallTracker`` knows how to see through. Usenet has no
      equivalent — SAB either downloads or errors — so the usenet caller
      passes neither and the loop behaves exactly as before.

      This is #1139: the per-track torrent path already tracked stalls, but
      the album-bundle path did not, so a dead magnet held an album batch for
      the FULL poll deadline (hours, thousands of polls) while
      ``torrent_stall_timeout_seconds`` was configured and simply never
      consulted.

    Returns the adapter's reported save_path (or, as a last resort, its
    stability-confirmed ``incomplete_path``) on terminal success, or
    ``None`` on any failure (timeout / disappeared / explicit failed /
    stalled / shutdown). On every failure path emits ``'failed'`` once with
    an ``error`` field describing why.
