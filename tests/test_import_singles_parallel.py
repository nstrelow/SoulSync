"""Regression tests for parallel singles-import processing.

Discord-reported (fresh.dumbledore + maintainer ack): the
``/api/import/singles/process`` endpoint processed staging files
sequentially in a Python ``for`` loop. Per-file work is dominated by
metadata search round-trips (Spotify/iTunes/Deezer), so a
multi-track manual import on a typical home network was painfully
slow. The maintainer acknowledged needing multiple workers.

These tests pin the new behaviour:

- The per-file worker function exists, returns a typed outcome
  ``(status, payload)``, and is safe to call concurrently from the
  shared ThreadPoolExecutor.
- Successful files report ``("ok", final_title)`` so the route can
  count them.
- Failed metadata resolution / bad files report ``("error", msg)``.
- A worker that raises an unexpected exception is caught by the
  caller (the test verifies that behaviour through the route).
