"""Preferring a specific version of a track, and the detector bug in the way.

Two things live here because one blocked the other.

**The bug.** ``detect_version_type`` walks a dict of version patterns and stops
at the first hit. ``\\bedit\\b`` is one of the *remix* patterns and remix used to
sit first, so "Radio Edit" and "Clean Edit" came back as remixes. Remix is
reject-on-sight, so a radio edit scored 0.0 and got thrown away — including when
the source title asked for the radio edit by name. The 'radio' entry with its
gentle 0.08 penalty was unreachable.

**The feature.** A user adds a track to a Spotify playlist and only the radio
edit exists there, but they want the extended mix whenever one is out there.
Rather than rewriting the request (which rejects the plain version and leaves you
with nothing when no extended mix exists), the preference is expressed at the
moment of picking: search the same, rank differently.

Deciding whether a candidate really is the asked-for version OF THIS TRACK was
the hard part, and the first two attempts were both wrong. Confidence scores the
whole file PATH with fuzzy similarity, and real Soulseek paths are mostly noise
("@@dl/", "[FLAC]", "VA/Compilation Vol 3/"). Measured against 'Song' the right
file scored 0.751 and a wrong one 0.743 — eight thousandths apart — while
genuine matches in messy folders scored no better than impostors. An absolute
threshold fired on 2 of 7 realistic filename shapes; a delta threshold couldn't
separate them at all.

So the gate compares the TITLE, not the path: reduce both sides to the bare song
name and require equality. Exact match, no threshold to get wrong.

**Two holes a later review found, both covered below.** Ranking in the matching
engine turned out not to be the last word: the download walk re-sorted the same
list confidence-first and put the plain version straight back on top, so the
setting did nothing at all. And AcoustID's version gate compared the source
title's version against the fingerprinted recording's and quarantined the file
the setting had just gone and found. Neither showed up in the engine's own
tests, because neither lives in the engine — the lesson being that a ranking
change is only real if you follow the file all the way to disk.

The other load-bearing claim is that it is OFF by default and provably inert
when off — ``preferred_hit`` is 0 for every candidate with no preference set, so
the sort tuple compares exactly as it did before.
