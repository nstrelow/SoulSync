"""Last-resort, version-stripped download query.

`generate_download_queries` preserves version decoration on purpose so a search
for a specific cut doesn't return a different one. That left no rung of the
ladder without the suffix, so a track whose exact edition no peer shares never
resolved at all. Priority 5 adds the broad query at the END, where it can only
be reached once every version-faithful variant has already failed.
