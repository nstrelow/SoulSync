"""`match_recording` has to reach a recording credited in the artist's
native script, even when the caller only has a romanised/cross-script name.

Root cause: MusicBrainz's `/recording` search field-scopes `artist` to the
CREDIT printed on that specific recording — never the artist entity's
aliases, and there is no alias field on `/recording` at all. So
`search_recording(strict=True)`'s `artist:"..."` clause structurally cannot
match `"Tatsuro Yamashita"` against a recording credited `山下達郎`, however
exact the title is (verified live: `artist:"Tatsuro Yamashita" AND
recording:"Sparkle"` → 0 hits; artist search `"Tatsuro Yamashita"` → 山下達郎
score 100; `arid:<id> AND recording:"Sparkle"` → hit).

The fix: when the plain name+artist search finds nothing usable, resolve the
artist via the alias-aware `search_artist(strict=False)` and retry the
recording search pinned to that MBID (`arid:<mbid>`) instead of the printed
credit text — but only when that artist resolution is unambiguous, since a
wrong pin here is a wrong recording match written into the cache.
