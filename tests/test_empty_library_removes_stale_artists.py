"""Round 4 of 5BILLION's empty-library bug: Refresh never reached removal.

History, because it matters for why this kept bouncing:

  round 1  dd87e3d22  deep scan cleans stale artists after switching libraries
  round 2  e3c15fb6a  Navidrome's empty-library API ERROR reads as verified empty
  round 3  8d8d6df85  verified-empty works with no music folder selected

All three are in 3.1.9. 5BILLION is running 3.1.9 and reports it STILL fails.
All three landed in ``run_deep_scan()``. He clicks **Refresh**, which runs
``run()`` — and that path still had the original behaviour:

    artists = self._get_all_artists()
    if not artists:
        emit error; return          # <-- returns BEFORE the removal phase

So "Refresh completes, but also fails to remove previous artists" was literally
what the code did. And even reaching removal would not have helped:
``_detect_and_remove_stale_content`` treated an empty catalogue as "the API
call failed" with no notion of a verified empty server, for every server type.

The safety property being protected throughout: a VERIFIED empty library may
delete rows; an UNVERIFIED empty (a failed fetch, a bad folder id) may never.
Deleting a user's library because the API had a bad minute is the one outcome
worse than not deleting at all.
