"""A YouTube block must say so, not read as "nothing found" (#1126).

fabian42069 ran SoulSync in Docker on a server. It worked for a day, then
YouTube stopped answering — the classic datacenter-IP bot gate. SoulSync is not
what broke, and cannot unbreak it. But everything he was shown pointed AWAY from
the cause:

  · Search → "No results found for 'the living'"
  · Settings → "soulseek service check failed: YouTube download source not
    available."
  · Downloads → "0 tracks downloaded" / "Download status: Not Found"

Three messages that describe SoulSync failing to FIND something, when what
happened is YouTube refusing us. He then deleted his config, re-pulled the
image, re-exported cookies twice and switched download source — none of which
could have helped, and all of which the messages invited.

Two defects behind that, pinned here:

1. ``check_connection`` was the only yt-dlp call in the client that went out
   WITHOUT cookies (search and download both apply them), so the Settings test
   could fail while real work succeeded.
2. Failures were logged and swallowed. The classifier that already tells
   YouTube's failures apart for the video side now runs on the music side too,
   and the reason reaches the status text.

    the "add cookies to fix the bot gate" advice turns working downloads into
