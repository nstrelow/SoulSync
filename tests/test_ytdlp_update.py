"""One-click yt-dlp update — and the three things it must not lie about.

Why this exists: the live install ran yt-dlp 2026.06.09 into August, and 22 videos
came back ``HTTP Error 403: Forbidden`` across many unrelated channels. One had
already burned all three retry attempts and been skipped permanently. The cause was
a package update the user had no in-app way to run.

The tests below are mostly about honesty rather than mechanics:

  · the update does NOT take effect until a restart, because ``yt_dlp`` is already
    imported and replacing files on disk does not replace a loaded module. A button
    that implies otherwise gets used once, appears to do nothing, and is never
    trusted again.
  · nightly is the default on purpose — stable lags on exactly the extractor fixes
    this exists to deliver — but it stays a choice.
  · pip fails in several ways that need completely different fixes (read-only
    container, distro-managed Python, wrong user, no network). Collapsing them into
    "update failed" sends people hunting the wrong thing.
