"""Hand-picked artwork must survive a library sync.

TheHomeGuy, on 3.2.0: he sets a custom cover in the art picker, it applies, and
then "if for some reason i need to manually sync the artist to the library, it
seems to remove the custom album art that I added". His screenshots show the
cover reverting to Navidrome's blue-vinyl placeholder.

The art picker looked like it pinned the choice, and its docstring said so — but
the pin was an accident of how OTHER code was written, not a property of the row:

    every enrichment worker fills art only WHERE thumb_url IS NULL OR = ''

so a non-empty value happened to survive *those* writers. A library sync is a
different writer with different rules. The album upsert had

    thumb_url = COALESCE(NULLIF(?, ''), thumb_url)

which only declines to write when the SERVER sends nothing — and Navidrome
always sends a cover URL, its own placeholder included. The artist upsert was
worse: a plain ``SET thumb_url = ?`` with no guard at all.

Nothing in the row said "a human chose this", so nothing could protect it.
``art_locked`` is that flag. These tests drive the REAL upserts against a REAL
database, because the bug was in SQL, and a mocked cursor would have happily
reported success while the row was overwritten.
