"""Guards that the audiobook subsystem cannot reach into music or video.

Podcasts had to be pulled back out of the music worker pool and the music
wishlist after the fact (cb6f1aeeb) because podcast batches were being picked up
by the music download engine. Audiobooks are born isolated instead, and these
tests are what keeps them that way as the subsystem grows: they read the
modules' real imports, calls and routes rather than trusting a comment.

The rules are not identical for every module, because the isolation that matters
is not "touch nothing shared".

  * Catalogue modules talk to Audible, which is metadata. They may not import an
    indexer client, a download client, or a throttle at all.
  * Acquisition modules talk to indexers and download clients, and they SHARE
    those with music and video on purpose — it is one Prowlarr in front of one
    set of indexers, and one qBittorrent. What they may never touch is the music
    side's own state: its batches, its worker pool, its wishlist, its database.

Every module in the subsystem is held to the second rule; the catalogue ones are
additionally held to the first.
