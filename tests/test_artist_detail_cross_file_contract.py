"""What other files borrow from library-globals.js — the contract that outlived library.js.

The automations migration taught this lesson once: the page being replaced was
not the only consumer of the code behind it, and the cleanup PR nearly deleted
things the video side still called. The library-list cleanup then taught it
again the hard way, by deleting four declarations that the artist-detail page
still needed.

So this file records every name on the cross-file contract. The cleanup DID
run: library.js is deleted, and everything below moved VERBATIM into
library-globals.js — the deliberate migration this test existed to force.
(`_esc` left the contract with it: library.js's copy was a known dupe of
stats-automations.js's, which loads later and was already the winner.)

The surprising ones, which is exactly why this is written down:

  * `artistDetailPageState` is read by **stats-automations.js**. Two of the
    artist-detail page's own buttons -- Play Artist Radio, and writing the
    artist photo to disk -- are implemented over there and reach back into this
    page's state. The page's behaviour is split across two files.

  * `playLibraryTrack` (144 lines, and on the shared spine of the artist-detail
    call graph) is called by five other files. It cannot move into a React
    component; it has to stay reachable as a global.
