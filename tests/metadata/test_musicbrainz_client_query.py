"""Query-construction tests for core/musicbrainz_client.py.

Regression guard for #754: the user-facing "Search for Match" / Fix popup
runs non-strict (strict=False) MusicBrainz searches. The old non-strict path
built a bare "track artist" blob with NO field scoping, so the artist was just
a free fuzzy term — covers/karaoke whose TITLES contained the artist name
outranked the real recording (e.g. "Sweet Child O Mine" / "Guns N Roses"
returned only covers, never the Guns N' Roses original).

The fix keeps the track/album side loose (diacritic + bracket recall) but
field-scopes the artist (artist:(...)) so it actually constrains. These tests
pin the query STRING the client sends — no network — by capturing the params
passed to session.get.
