"""#1257: every album listed each track twice after a reorganize (plex, 230k files).

the chain: reorganize moves the file and repoints its row (plex id X) at the
new path. plex does not track moves: it trashes X and mints a new item Y for
the same file. the next scan inserts Y beside X. only the deep scan ever
removed X, and its 50% safety skipped exactly the libraries that had this
the worst (a reorganized library is nearly half superseded rows).

now: a trashed plex item is never written, and every scan ends by folding a
row the server no longer lists into the live row for the same file, carrying
its enrichment and play history. driven through the deep scan here: a full
refresh wipes the server's rows first (and the enrichment with them), so
the deep scan is the one a reorganized library should run.
