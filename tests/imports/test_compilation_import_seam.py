"""The seam: what actually lands in the library when a compilation imports.

The helper's own tests only prove it returns the right string. This drives
``record_soulsync_library_entry`` against a REAL database and reads the rows
back, because the bug being fixed was never in the decision — it was in which
artist the album row was written under.

Pinned here: the album moves to Various Artists AND the track keeps the artist
who actually recorded it. Moving both would trade one wrong answer for
another — Don Felder really is the artist of his track on that soundtrack.
