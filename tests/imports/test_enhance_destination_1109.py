"""#1109 — "Upgraded track lands in library root not artist/album".

A quality upgrade ("enhance") reuses the existing library file's location so the
better copy replaces the worse one in place. It got that location from
`source_info['original_file_path']` — the path as RECORDED IN THE DATABASE.

That recorded path is usually the MEDIA SERVER's view of the library
("/music/Artist/Album/…"), not a path the SoulSync container can reach. The old
code took `os.path.dirname` of it and ran `makedirs` unconditionally, which
either fabricated a container-local `/music` tree that nothing else could see,
or raised PermissionError and aborted post-processing outright — leaving the
finished download unsorted. The reporter's log showed exactly that: files "not
even copied due to no permission", while a plain (non-upgrade) download of the
same album sorted correctly via `resolve_existing_album_folder`.

The rule now: an unreachable original is not a destination. Only an existing,
reachable directory is reused; anything else falls through to the normal
template so the upgrade still lands in Artist/Album.
