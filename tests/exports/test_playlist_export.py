"""Playlist export orchestrator (#903): dedup + stats + progress accounting.

Pins: repeated songs resolve once (deduped), per-source breakdown counts only fresh
resolutions, unmatched tracks carry recording_mbid=None but stay in order, alternate
field shapes (artist_name/track_name) are accepted, and a throwing progress callback
never fails the export.
