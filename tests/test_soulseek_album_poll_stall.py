"""Regression for the Soulseek album-bundle poll hanging when the peer stalls.

`_poll_album_bundle_downloads` waits for every transfer in the selected folder
to reach a terminal state (completed or failed). A transfer the peer stalls on —
stuck InProgress/Queued, or dropped by slskd — is never failed, never completed,
and never marked "completed-but-unresolved", so it used to block both the
all-terminal finish check AND the #715 grace exit, and the poll spun to the full
~6h timeout (the Slipknot hang).

The fix adds a bundle-level stall guard: if NOTHING progresses (no transfer
reaches terminal AND no pending transfer's byte count moves) for `_stall_grace`
seconds, the stuck transfers are marked failed so the bundle resolves with what
completed. These tests drive the real poll with a fake clock + scripted slskd
states.
