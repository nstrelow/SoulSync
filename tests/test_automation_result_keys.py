"""The card's last-run sentences must keep matching what handlers return.

`-automations.format.ts` turns a handler's result dict into a sentence —
"Checked 42 artists, wishlisted 7 tracks" instead of the raw
"artists_scanned: 42 · tracks_added_to_wishlist: 7". That is only an
improvement while the keys it reads are keys the handler still sets.

A sentence built from a key a handler stopped returning does not fail loudly:
it silently reads zero, and the card says "Checked 0 artists" about a scan
that worked. This is the seam that catches the rename.

Deliberately a source-text check rather than an import: the point is to pin
the literal key strings on both sides, and importing the handlers would drag
in the whole scanning stack to answer a question about two dictionaries.
