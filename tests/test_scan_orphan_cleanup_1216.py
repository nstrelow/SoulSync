"""#1216 — an incremental scan could permanently lose an album it had just written.

The scan inserts an album row, then its tracks, then sweeps orphans. Between
the first two steps a real album legitimately has zero tracks, so if the
server's track list for that one album comes back short (no exception, no
timeout - just an incomplete answer) the sweep deletes the row the same run
created.

That loss is permanent, not transient: with the row gone the media server no
longer reports the album as recently added, so the next incremental scan never
rediscovers it. The reporter watched the same "Added artist ... for processing"
line repeat every scan forever with nothing landing.

The rule: a row this run touched is not an orphan yet. Only rows left trackless
by an EARLIER run are.
