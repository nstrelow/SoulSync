"""A download that gives up has to say why.

Every exhausted retry recorded the same sentence — "No working release found
after retries". On Boulder's install that is 1,495 of 1,507 Soulseek failures
and 437 of 443 torrent ones: nearly two thousand history rows, no diagnosis in
any of them.

Those failures are not one problem. "Nothing was posted", "six were posted and
your profile refused them all", and "four peers were tried and none sent the
file" need three different responses from the user, and they read identically.
