"""TV ↔ YouTube episode-row parity (Boulder: "treat them the same").

Backend: POST /api/video/youtube/download — the row-level direct download (the
TV grab's YouTube equivalent, minus the search: the video IS the release).
Reuses the wishlist drain's enqueue (same row shape + per-channel overrides)
and its concurrency model. Frontend contracts: the yt row carries the same
.vd-ep-get action cluster (grab + wish, NO manual search), the season bar
appears for channels too, and the row wish toggle can actually UNWISH (the old
'vd-yt-wish--on' check matched no real button class, so ✓ re-added forever).
