"""Fresh Releases as a refreshed-and-cached board.

The tab used to pull EXT.to on the render path. Enriching each row from its own
detail page made that untenable — every detail page is its own Cloudflare
challenge, and a bad minute on ext.to costs 40 seconds a page — so the work moved
to ``refresh_board``, run by the hourly automation or the tab's Refresh button,
with the result stored and served.

These cover the things that make that affordable and honest: fetch each release
once, never re-fetch one we already matched, stop before the run runs away, and
say what was left out.
