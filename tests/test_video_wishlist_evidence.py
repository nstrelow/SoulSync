"""Keeping the receipt for a fruitless wishlist search.

A wanted item searches hourly, judges every candidate against the quality
profile, takes the best acceptable one — and when nothing qualifies, throws the
entire result set away and increments a counter. So a row that has searched forty
times looks identical to one waiting for next week's episode, and the user cannot
tell "be patient" from "this will never work".

Three rows on Boulder's install sit at thirteen fruitless searches (Aussie Shore
S02E03/E09/E10) with nothing on screen explaining any of them.

Everything needed is already in hand at the moment of refusal — each candidate
carries its ``quality_label`` and the ``rejected`` string naming the rule that
turned it down. The reason strings asserted here are taken from
``core.video.quality_eval``, not invented, because a classifier matched against
imagined text is worse than none: it would look right and silently classify
nothing.

The distinction that makes this worth storing: "Wrong season" means the release
is not this item (search noise), while "1080p WEB isn't in your enabled tiers"
means it IS this item and a rule of yours refused it. Only the second is worth
showing, and conflating them would report another show's episode as "best
available".
