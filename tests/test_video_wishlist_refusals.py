"""When the download client refuses a release, the wishlist must not blame quality.

Read out of Boulder's live install. ``Project.Pay.Day.2021.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H.264-EVO``
was sitting in his qBittorrent at ``metaDL`` 0%. Every hour the drain searched, found
that exact release, judged it ACCEPTED, offered it to qBittorrent, and qBittorrent
answered ``Fails.`` — its response to a torrent it already holds. Three things then
went wrong in a row:

1. ``_one`` fell through to the all-rejected branch and logged "none accepted — none
   met your quality profile", which was false: the release had passed the profile.
   The user is pointed at the one setting that cannot fix it.
2. ``record_outcome`` counted it as a fruitless search, so ``search_attempts`` climbed
   — 133 on that row, 198 on another — implying the release does not exist.
3. The next run re-picked the same top candidate and repeated all of it, forever. The
   second-best release was never offered.

The fix is one idea: **a refusal is evidence about the CLIENT, not about the release.**
So it gets its own outcome, it does not touch the fruitless-search counter, and the
drain walks on to the next acceptable candidate.
