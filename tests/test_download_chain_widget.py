"""One download-chain editor for all three media types.

Music, video and audiobooks each store the same thing — a mode plus an ordered
list of sources — and each had its own editor:

  * music      a drag list with status dots, cogs and per-source toggles
  * audiobooks arrow buttons and a checkbox, no drag, no status
  * video      a third implementation inside a pop-up on the video side only

Same concept, three looks, three behaviours, three places to keep in step. This
is one widget with three adapters; the adapters are the only part that differs,
because where the chain is read from and written back to is the only real
difference between them.

A chain of one IS single-source mode. There is no separate mode switch, because
mode and order were never independent: a user choosing one source and a user
dragging one source into the chain mean the same thing.
