"""Guards for the audiobook settings surface.

Two things are being protected here.

The first is that audiobooks have their OWN download source chain. Music's chain
lists tidal, qobuz, hifi, deezer and amazon — music-streaming services with no
audiobooks in them at all — so a book searched down the music chain burns an
attempt on each of them before it can succeed. The download ENGINE is shared on
purpose (an audiobook is structurally an album: a directory of ordered chapter
files with shared metadata, which is what album_bundle already handles); only the
ordering of sources differs.

The second is that a setting nobody wired up is a setting that does not exist.
Every new field is checked all the way through: the default, the input in
index.html, the code that loads it, and the code that saves it.
