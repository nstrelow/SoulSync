"""Settings paths UX (Discord: Kazimir Iskander + wolf39us).

The through-line that misled non-Docker users: a "don't touch" warning sat on
the Download/Music-Library fields (which Proxmox-LXC/bare-metal users MUST
edit), while the section below described itself exactly like the output folder
— so people set "Music Library Paths" and never touched the real output. The
copy now: explains the download → post-process → library pipeline, addresses
Docker AND non-Docker explicitly (Docker is not assumed to be the norm), and
the extra-libraries section leads with "you don't need to repeat it here".
