"""Three things found while diagnosing Sokhi's "stuck on processing" report.

None of them were his actual bug (that was post-processing queueing behind
searches, fixed separately). They came out of reading the code around it.

1. **"Concurrent Downloads" stopped meaning anything above 3.** The setting
   offers 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10 and is a PER BATCH limit, but the worker pool was a
   hardwired ``max_workers=3``. So a batch would start 10 workers and 7 sat in
   the executor queue. Measured: settings 4,5,6,8,10 all gave a peak of 3
   running at once, while the help text promised "higher values speed up large
   playlists and wishlists".

2. **A batch wedged in post_processing had no rescue.** The Safety Valve covers
   searching / queued / downloading only. The 30-minute post_processing timeout
   lives inside ``check_batch_completion_v2``, which batch healing only called
   when the batch had ORPHANS — and a batch whose remaining tasks are all
   post_processing produces none. So nothing ever asked, and it held its slots.

3. **Orphans were re-reported forever.** Healing found finished tasks still in
   ``batch['queue']`` and never removed them, so the same ones came back every
   30s. Sokhi's log has the identical 13 re-reported across the whole window.
   They are still not removed — ``queue_index`` is a POSITION into that list and
   shrinking it underneath would make the batch skip or repeat tasks — but they
   are only reported and acted on once.
