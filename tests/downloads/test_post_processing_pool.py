"""Post-processing must not queue behind Soulseek searches.

Sokhi: "after a while the songs start getting stuck on processing and that
prevents other songs from being downloaded."

Nothing was hung. ``missing_download_executor`` is a 3-worker pool that ran
BOTH the search/download workers and post-processing, and the monitor sets a
task to ``post_processing`` the moment the transfer finishes — before the work
is queued:

    task['status'] = 'post_processing'                      # UI says "Processing"
    ...
    executor.submit(_run_post_processing_worker, ...)       # may just sit in line

So a finished download waited behind searches that take 25-60s each and usually
find nothing. From his log, task 66f9ed16:

    13:28:32  [Monitor] Submitting post-processing worker
    13:29:24  Waiting for file to stabilise      <- worker finally starts
    13:29:27  quarantined, requeued

52 seconds in line, 3 seconds of actual work. And ``post_processing`` counts as
active in batch healing, so the batch would not start its next song for the
whole 52s. That is the reported symptom exactly.

The fix is the one this codebase already made for #740, when album-bundle
downloads were starving the per-track flow off the same pool: give the work its
own bounded executor. Same reasoning, same shape.
