"""The art endpoints that lock and release a hand-picked image.

POST /api/album/<id>/art and /api/artist/<id>/art apply a pick — and now LOCK it,
so the next library sync cannot write the media server's art back over it
(TheHomeGuy: "if for some reason i need to manually sync the artist to the
library, it seems to remove the custom album art that I added").

DELETE on the same URLs is the way back. It exists because the picker sources its
candidates from external services only and can find none at all — his own
screenshot reads "No alternative covers found for this album" — so a user who
locked art they no longer want would otherwise have nothing to switch to.

The database behaviour is covered by test_custom_art_survives_sync.py; these
tests are about the HTTP surface: does the endpoint reach the lock, and does it
answer honestly when the row isn't there.
