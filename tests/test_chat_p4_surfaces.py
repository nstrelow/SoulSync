"""Chat next-level P4 — polls, pins, room topic, tuned-in presence.

Zero new server surface: all four features are pure folds over the P1
protocol bus (reducePins / reducePoll / reduceTopic / reduceTuned in
chat-protocol.js — determinism covered in tests/static/test_chat_protocol.mjs).
These tests pin the frontend wiring contracts so a refactor can't quietly
detach a surface from the bus.
