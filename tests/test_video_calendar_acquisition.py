"""The calendar says where each episode stands, not just when it airs.

Before this the feed carried the air date and `has_file`. That draws a grid and
nothing more: an episode that aired on Tuesday and is still missing looked
exactly like one that aired on Tuesday and is deliberately unmonitored, and both
looked exactly like one that was downloading at that moment.

Also covered: a calendar that has not refreshed is not empty, it is confidently
wrong — showing last month's idea of next week — so the feed reports its own
freshness and a never-refreshed install reads as stale rather than as fine.
