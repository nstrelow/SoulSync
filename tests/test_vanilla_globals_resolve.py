"""Every name the vanilla scripts reference must actually be declared.

Written after a real breakage: the library-list cleanup deleted 14 functions by
computing each one's span as "from `function X(` to the start of the next
function". Four top-level declarations sat BETWEEN two of those functions and
were swallowed with them --

    _ARTIST_DETAIL_BACK_LABELS   _artistDetailLabelStack
    _artistDetailGoingBack       artistDetailPageState

-- which left 177 references to `artistDetailPageState` in library.js pointing
at nothing. Artist detail threw ReferenceError on open, and it shipped: the
file still PARSED, so `node --check` passed; the Python suites only read these
files as text; and the vitest suite never loads them at all. Nothing in the
repo could see it.

The check: lint each static script for `no-undef` with every OTHER script's
top-level declarations supplied as globals (they share one scope through
<script> tags, so oxlint linting them in isolation is meaningless on its own).
The file's own declarations are deliberately EXCLUDED -- including them is what
would let a file mask the deletion of its own state.

Baselines are per file and pinned. They are pre-existing findings, not a
target: several are genuine latent bugs worth fixing on their own. The test
guards the DELTA -- it fails when a change adds a new unresolved name.

Widened 2026-07-30 to cover EVERY static script, after it missed a second
breakage of exactly the kind it was written for. The Downloads-page port
deleted the only definition of `_updateDlNavBadge`, which core.js:664 and
shared-helpers.js:4040 both still call from the websocket status handler --
a ReferenceError on every push, aborting the rest of both handlers. The test
could not see it because it was parametrized over `_BASELINE`, and that dict
held one entry: library.js. The other 42 scripts were never linted at all.

A guard that covers one file is a guard against one incident. Files with no
recorded baseline default to zero, so a newly-orphaned reference in any script
now fails.
