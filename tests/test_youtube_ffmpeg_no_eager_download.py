"""Pin the YouTube client's "don't auto-download ffmpeg during tests"
gate.

kettui (Cin) reported on 2026-05-08 that the docker image roughly
doubled in size after a recent nightly. Codex investigation:

- nightly workflow runs ``python -m pytest`` BEFORE the docker build
- ``tests/test_tidal_auth_instructions.py`` imports ``web_server``
- importing web_server constructs YouTubeClient via the orchestrator
  registry boot
- the registry probes ``is_configured()`` which delegates to
  ``is_available()`` which used to call ``_check_ffmpeg()`` with the
  download side-effect enabled
- CI runner has no ffmpeg on PATH → download fired → ~388 MB of
  ffmpeg/ffprobe binaries landed in ``./tools/``
- ``.dockerignore`` didn't exclude them → ``COPY . .`` shipped them →
  the immediately-following ``chown -R /app`` rewrote them into
  another layer → image size doubled

Three-layer fix:
1. ``.dockerignore`` blocks the binaries (defense in depth)
2. Dockerfile ``COPY --chown`` skips the duplicating chown layer
3. THIS GATE: ``YouTubeClient._auto_download_disabled()`` returns True
   under pytest (PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST env, ``pytest in sys.modules``)
   or when ``SOULSYNC_NO_FFMPEG_DOWNLOAD=1`` is set

These tests pin layer 3 so the regression can't come back via a
future test importing web_server with no environment guard.
