"""Live progress while a Deezer playlist resolves (TheHomeGuy).

    "System seems to hang when trying to load large playlist. Will sit here for
    several minutes doing nothing."

Nothing was hanging. Loading a playlist resolves every unique album twice — once
for release dates, once for real track numbers — and both are rate-limited
requests. A 1,219-track playlist is roughly 900 albums, so ~1,750 calls at 8/s:
minutes of genuine work behind a spinner that said only "Loading playlist: X...".

That is indistinguishable from broken, and it was reported as broken. The work
itself cannot go away — release dates and track numbers are what the download
picker uses to choose a candidate and verify it is the right one — so the fix is
to narrate it.

The seam is the one the shell already uses: the server emits on the socket,
core.js re-broadcasts as an ``ss:`` CustomEvent (``socket`` is a module-scoped
``let`` there, unreachable from a React route), and the card listens while its
fetch is in flight. Same shape as ``ss:discovery-progress`` and
``ss:repair-progress``.

Everything here is best-effort by construction: a progress callback that throws,
a socket that is down, an older server that never emits — none of it may affect
whether the playlist loads.

Later: the same silence was reported again, on the OTHER deezer path. The ARL
account tab passed a progress_cb and narrated; the paste-a-link tab passed None
and sat on "Loading..." for minutes on a 1500-track playlist. Same feature, two
paths, one of them wired. Both are covered here now, and the event constant
moved to -sync.events.ts so the two consumers cannot drift apart.
