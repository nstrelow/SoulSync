"""The Sources tab: every download source configurable in one place.

The per-source config used to live inside the Downloads tab's "Source Settings"
section, hidden behind a cog on the hybrid-order widget, revealed one at a time.
Two problems with that, one cosmetic and one not:

  * You had to know the cog was there at all.
  * ``showCfg`` was ``activeSources.has(src) && ...``, so a source's settings only
    existed on screen if that source was ALREADY enabled. Setting up Tidal meant
    switching Tidal on first, saving a half-configured source into the chain, and
    only then being allowed to fill in the account details.

The ordering widget deliberately stays on Downloads; only the configuration moved.
