"""A stall clock that survives a restart, and notices "finished but unfindable".

Both defects were read off the live install.

**The clock was wiped by every restart.** Six torrents sat at the same percentage
for 199 minutes against a 30-minute timeout and were never failed — SoulSync had
restarted inside the window, and the clock, being a module dict keyed off
``time.monotonic()``, restarted with it. The perverse consequence: the longer a
download had been stuck, the more restarts it had survived, and the *less* likely
it was to ever be caught. Storing the clock on the row fixes it, and wall-clock is
also the measure a person uses looking at the page — "this hasn't moved since 4pm".

**Finishing with no findable file was not tracked at all.** When a torrent reports
complete and the importer can't locate its file, the patch carries progress and NO
status. The old branch matched only ``queued``/``downloading``, so that row fell
through every guard and spun at 100% forever. On a library spread over eleven mount
roots, an unresolvable save path is exactly how that happens — so it gets its own
message, because telling someone "no progress" when the bytes are already on disk
sends them hunting seeders that were never the problem.
