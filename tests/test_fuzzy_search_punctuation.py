"""Punctuated titles were unfindable in the manual-match search (#1159, AfonsoG6).

    "In some weird edge cases I'm unable to find the tracks I know I have. When
    searching for the song "Would've, Could've, Should've" by Taylor Swift, only
    other songs with the word "Should've" appear. The commas may be interfering
    somehow."

He was right that commas were involved, though not where he'd expect. The basic
LIKE handles them fine — it is the FUZZY fallback, which only runs when the basic
search found nothing at all (``if basic_rows: return`` in ``api_search_tracks``),
so it is exactly the path a user hits when the library's tag differs from the
source title.

It split on whitespace and stripped only whitespace, leaving punctuation glued
to each token:

    "Would've, Could've, Should've"  ->  %would've,%  %could've,%  %should've%

``%would've,%`` matches only a title that has the comma too. A library file
tagged **without** the commas — which taggers and filesystems routinely do —
therefore matched on ``%should've%`` alone, scoring 1, the same as every
unrelated song containing that one word. The tie then fell back to alphabetical
order and the real track landed at rank 3, behind the noise. That is his report
exactly.

Trimming ends only. Internal punctuation has to survive (N.W.A, P!nk,
"pepper's"), and the column side keeps its own punctuation because
``unidecode_lower`` only lowercases — so a trimmed term matches everything the
untrimmed one did and more. It can raise a row's score, never lower it.
