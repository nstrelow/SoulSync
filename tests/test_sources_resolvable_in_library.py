"""sources_resolvable_in_library(): which watchlist ids land on a library artist.

Second half of the watchlist "provider is unavailable" fix. The panel's
discography link is safe on a source when the provider is alive OR when its id
resolves to a library artist by the ID COLUMN alone — the artist-detail route
upgrades to the library view off that column with no provider call, and its
name-retry fallback needs the (dead) provider's client, so ids that only match
by name or match ambiguously genuinely 503 and must NOT be vouched for.
